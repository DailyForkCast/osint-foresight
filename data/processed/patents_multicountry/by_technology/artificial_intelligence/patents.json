      "abstract": "Systems and methods for compensating multiply and accumulate (MAC) operations are described. A processor can send an input vector to a first portion of a memory device. The first portion can store synaptic weights of a trained artificial neural network (ANN). The processor can read a first result of a MAC operation performed on the input vector and the synaptic weights stored in the first portion. The processor can send an inverse of the input vector to a second portion of the memory device. The processor can read a second result of a MAC operation performed on the inverse of the input vector and an inverse of synaptic weights stored in the second portion. The processor can combine the first result and the second result to generate a final result. The final result can be a compensated version of the first result.",

In a method for visual data processing, for a conversion between a current visual unit of visual data and a bitstream of the visual data, at least one wavelet subband representation of the current visual unit is determined based on a neural network-based non-linear transformation or a neural network-based inverse non-linear transformation inverse to the non-linear transformation. A wavelet subband representation is associated with a subband of a wavelet of the current visual unit. The conversion is performed based on the at least one wavelet subband representation.",

The refinement process can proceed by broadcasting the differentially privatised global model to the network of user equipment as part of a refinement iteration, receiving updated versions of the multiple differentially privatised local models from the network of user equipment, and on the basis of a convergence threshold representing convergence of the differentially privatised global model to a selected measure of accuracy according to a loss function, using the differentially privatised global model to generate a set of synthetic data by selecting a set of random latent features using a predefined distribution as input to the differentially privatised global model whereby to generate a set of synthetic data as output of the differentially privatised global model. The generated synthetic data can be used for data mining and the building of machine learning models and so on.",
