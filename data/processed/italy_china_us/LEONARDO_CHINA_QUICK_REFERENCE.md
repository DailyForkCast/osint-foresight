# Leonardo-China Investigation: Quick Reference

*Generated: 2025-09-14 13:46*

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Next 2 Hours)

### 1. Check Leonardo China Presence
- Search: "Leonardo Beijing office" OR "Leonardo Shanghai"
- Check Leonardo annual report for China revenue
- LinkedIn: Search employees at "Leonardo China"

### 2. BRI Participation
- Search: "Leonardo Belt and Road"
- Check: Italy BRI status (withdrew 2024)
- Look for: Ongoing projects despite withdrawal

### 3. Investment Scan
- Search: "Chinese investment Leonardo"
- Check: CFIUS/CIFIUS reports
- Look for: Minority stakes, joint ventures

## HIGH-RISK INDICATORS TO WATCH

### CRITICAL (Immediate Investigation)
- Leonardo subsidiary in China
- Chinese military university collaboration
- Thousand Talents Program participation
- Leonardo tech in Chinese military systems

### HIGH (Within 24 Hours)
- Chinese investment in Leonardo suppliers
- Joint research programs
- Technology licensing to China
- Cyber attacks from China

## SEARCH QUERIES TO RUN NOW

### Google:
```
"Leonardo" "China" (contract OR partnership OR agreement)
"Leonardo SpA" (Beijing OR Shanghai OR Shenzhen)
"Leonardo" "AVIC" aerospace
"Leonardo" "Belt and Road"
"Leonardo DRS" China
```

### LinkedIn:
```
Current Company: Leonardo
Location: China
---
Past Company: Leonardo
Current Company: (Chinese company)
---
Leonardo "Thousand Talents"
```

### Patent Databases:
```
Assignee: Leonardo
Inventor country: China
---
Assignee: (Chinese entity)
Citation: Leonardo patent
```

## KEY ENTITIES TO INVESTIGATE

### Chinese Companies to Check:
- AVIC (Aviation Industry Corporation)
- NORINCO (China North Industries)
- CETC (China Electronics Technology)
- Huawei
- ZTE

### Italian Entities at Risk:
- Leonardo S.p.A. (parent)
- Leonardo DRS (US subsidiary)
- AgustaWestland (helicopters)
- Selex ES (electronics)
- OTO Melara (naval systems)

## TECHNOLOGY AREAS OF CONCERN

### Highest Risk:
1. Night vision/thermal imaging
2. Electronic warfare systems
3. Radar technology
4. Helicopter systems
5. Naval weapons

### Dual-Use Concerns:
1. Quantum sensing
2. AI/ML algorithms
3. Advanced materials
4. Satellite technology
5. Cybersecurity tools

## INTELLIGENCE GAPS TO FILL

1. **Direct Contracts**: Any Leonardo contracts with Chinese entities?
2. **Personnel**: Chinese nationals in sensitive Leonardo positions?
3. **Investment**: Chinese stakes in Leonardo or suppliers?
4. **Technology Transfer**: Leonardo tech in Chinese systems?
5. **Cyber**: Chinese APT targeting of Leonardo?

## BOTTOM LINE

**Every Leonardo connection to China represents a potential pathway for US technology compromise through the Italian subsidiary Leonardo DRS.**

Focus on:
- Direct Leonardo-China business relationships
- Indirect access through Italian research institutions
- Supply chain vulnerabilities
- Personnel with dual loyalties
- Technology that has already transferred

---

**Time Requirement**: 2-4 hours for initial scan
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Leonardo DRS has 14,514 US defense contracts
**Risk**: US military technology accessible to China through Italy
