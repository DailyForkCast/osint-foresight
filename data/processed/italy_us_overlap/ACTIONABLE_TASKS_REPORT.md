# Italy-US Overlap: Actionable Intelligence Tasks

*Generated: 2025-09-14 13:03*

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Do Today)

### 1. Supply Chain Intelligence

**Key Findings:**
- **F-35**: Leonardo at Cameri FACO
  - Component: Final Assembly and Check-Out
  - Export Control: ITAR
  - Single Source Risk: True
- **787 Dreamliner**: Leonardo at Foggia, Grottaglie
  - Component: Horizontal stabilizer, center fuselage sections
  - Export Control: EAR
  - Single Source Risk: False
- **Constellation-class Frigate (FFG-62)**: Fincantieri at Design from FREMM (Italy)
  - Component: Ship design and systems integration
  - Export Control: ITAR
  - Single Source Risk: True

### 2. Immediate Computer-Based Tasks

#### Today's Priority Tasks:

**Task 1: Extract Leonardo US contracts from FPDS.gov**
- URL: https://www.fpds.gov
- Query: `Vendor name: "Leonardo" OR "Leonardo DRS"`
- Value: Identify all US federal contracts to Italian entities
- Time: 2 hours

**Task 2: Map Politecnico Milano-MIT joint publications**
- URL: https://www.scopus.com
- Query: `AFFIL(politecnico AND milano) AND AFFIL(MIT)`
- Value: Identify research overlap areas and key personnel
- Time: 3 hours

**Task 3: Analyze Fincantieri SEC filings**
- URL: https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/
- Query: `Fincantieri Marine Group`
- Value: Financial data on US operations
- Time: 2 hours

### 3. OSINT Collection Priorities

#### High-Value Queries:
1. **FPDS.gov**: All Leonardo DRS contracts 2020-2025
2. **SAM.gov**: Active Leonardo facility clearances
3. **USAspending.gov**: Italian entity federal grants
4. **Patents.google.com**: Leonardo + US assignee co-patents
5. **SEC EDGAR**: Fincantieri Marine Group 10-K filings

### 4. Research Collaboration Mapping

#### Priority Institution Pairs:
- **Politecnico di Milano ↔ MIT**
  - Domain: Quantum Computing
  - Departments: Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria ↔ Research Laboratory of Electronics
  - Outputs: 12 papers, 2 projects
- **Sapienza University of Rome ↔ Stanford University**
  - Domain: Artificial Intelligence
  - Departments: Department of Computer, Control and Management Engineering ↔ Computer Science - AI Lab
  - Outputs: 8 papers, 1 projects

### 5. Quick Wins (< 1 Hour Each)

- [ ] Download Leonardo annual report for US revenue breakdown
- [ ] Check LinkedIn for Italian nationals at US defense primes
- [ ] Query Google Scholar for MIT-Politecnico joint papers 2023-2025
- [ ] Extract Thales Alenia Space US contracts from NASA SEWP
- [ ] Search "site:*.mil Leonardo" for military program mentions

### 6. Python Scripts to Create

```python
# Priority automation tasks:
1. fpds_leonardo_scraper.py - Extract all Leonardo federal contracts
2. orcid_italy_us_mapper.py - Map researcher movements
3. patents_coinventor.py - US-Italy patent collaboration network
4. sec_edgar_parser.py - Italian subsidiary financial extraction
5. cordis_us_filter.py - Find US entities in EU projects
```

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Today**: Complete all immediate action tasks
2. **This Week**: Build automation scripts
3. **Next Week**: Department-level collaboration mapping
4. **Two Weeks**: Complete micro-artifact population
