1	No concerning PRC relationships	Austria's international collaboration network shows no direct PRC institutional ties based on current evidence. The Phase 5 PRC entity screen found no concerning nexuses among all identified partners. Austria's primary collaborations remain firmly within EU frameworks (EuroHPC, EuroCC) and Western academic institutions (US, Germany, Belgium, UK). This clean baseline suggests any PRC interest would need to operate through indirect mechanisms rather than established partnerships. The absence of PRC entities in Austria's research ecosystem may reflect both EU governance structures and Austria's strategic positioning within Western technology networks. Continued monitoring should focus on conference participation and emerging collaboration proposals.	Clean PRC screen baseline	prc_screen.tsv	Primary finding
2	EuroHPC/VSC as indirect vector	While no direct PRC links exist, Austria's HPC infrastructure could attract interest through legitimate academic channels. The VSC and EuroHPC access represent significant computational resources that naturally draw global research attention. EU allocation policies and access controls provide governance, but published research outputs and software contributions remain openly accessible. The compute infrastructure's value lies not in the hardware itself but in the methods and optimizations developed through its use. Any PRC interest would likely manifest through conference participation, collaborative proposals, or recruitment of researchers with VSC experience rather than direct institutional partnerships.

3	Standards influence potential	Austria's IETF participation in IPPM and NTP working groups represents a subtle influence vector that could attract strategic interest. While the IETF's open process ensures transparency, persistent participation enables gradual steering of technical specifications. Time synchronization and performance measurement protocols underpin critical infrastructure globally. Any PRC interest would likely focus on understanding Austrian positions on key specifications and potentially coordinating positions through other IETF participants. The open nature of standards development makes this a low-barrier engagement vector, though actual influence remains constrained by consensus requirements and multi-stakeholder review processes.
