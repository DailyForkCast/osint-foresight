1	EuroHPC LEONARDO	IT	promising	The EuroHPC LEONARDO supercomputer in Bologna provides Austrian researchers with pre-exascale computing capabilities under EU governance frameworks. This infrastructure access enables Austrian institutions to run large-scale AI training workloads and complex simulations without developing sovereign capabilities from scratch. The relationship is governed by transparent EU allocation policies and includes technology transfer safeguards. Austrian users benefit from shared software stacks and optimization expertise while contributing to the broader European HPC ecosystem. The collaboration strengthens regional resilience against compute dependence on non-EU providers.	EU governance; access benefits	[EuroHPC_node]	Infrastructure partnership
2	Carnegie Mellon University	US	promising	CMU's collaboration with ISTA on NeurIPS 2024 papers represents high-caliber AI methods research with a leading US institution. This partnership provides Austrian researchers with exposure to cutting-edge ML techniques and access to elite research networks. The academic nature and open publication model ensure knowledge diffusion benefits Austria's AI ecosystem. CMU's strong industry connections may create downstream opportunities for Austrian startups and research commercialization. The collaboration enhances Austria's visibility in the global AI research community.	Elite AI research access	[NeurIPS_2024]	Academic excellence
3	imec	BE	neutral	Belgium's imec semiconductor research center collaboration with Austrian AI researchers bridges hardware-software optimization domains. This connection positions Austria at the intersection of AI algorithms and specialized chip design, potentially enabling more efficient model deployment. The partnership provides insights into semiconductor supply chains and fabrication constraints relevant to AI acceleration. However, the dual-use nature of advanced semiconductors warrants monitoring for technology control implications. The collaboration currently focuses on open research with published outcomes.

4	EuroCC Slovenia (SLING)	SI	promising	The EuroCC Slovenia partnership exemplifies effective regional HPC competence building within the EU framework. This collaboration provides Austrian institutions with shared training programs, best practices exchange, and coordinated user support across borders. The partnership reduces duplication of effort in developing HPC curricula and documentation. Joint workshops and hackathons foster a regional community of practice that strengthens both countries' computational science capabilities. The relationship demonstrates how smaller EU members can pool resources for mutual benefit in specialized technical domains.	Regional capacity building	[EuroCC_2024]	Regional cooperation
5	University of Tübingen	DE	neutral	Tübingen's AI collaborations with Austrian institutions reflect natural DACH-region knowledge flows in machine learning research. The partnership combines German methodological rigor with Austrian computational resources, particularly through VSC access. Joint publications span computer vision, natural language processing, and theoretical ML foundations. The geographic proximity facilitates PhD exchanges and joint supervision arrangements. While currently focused on fundamental research, the relationship could evolve toward applied dual-use domains requiring closer monitoring.	DACH corridor strength	[Pub_2023]	Regional research ties
