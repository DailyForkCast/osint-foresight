## Risk Assessment

### Technology Transfer Risks

- **Materials:** 34 papers (MEDIUM risk)
- **Nuclear:** 30 papers (MEDIUM risk)
- **Artificial Intelligence:** 28 papers (MEDIUM risk)
- **Defense:** 12 papers (MEDIUM risk)
- **Biotechnology:** 9 papers (MEDIUM risk)
- **Aerospace:** 9 papers (MEDIUM risk)
- **Energy:** 6 papers (MEDIUM risk)
- **Semiconductors:** 2 papers (MEDIUM risk)
- **Cyber:** 1 papers (MEDIUM risk)

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate:** Review all critical technology collaborations with Chinese military-affiliated institutions
2. **Short-term:** Implement approval process for sensitive research collaborations
3. **Medium-term:** Develop guidelines for international research partnerships
4. **Long-term:** Build domestic research capacity to reduce dependency

## Conclusion

The 2.95% collaboration rate with China, while not extreme, concentrates in
critical technology areas that could enable strategic vulnerabilities. The presence of
3 high-risk collaborations requires immediate review and potential
restrictions to protect Italian technological sovereignty.
