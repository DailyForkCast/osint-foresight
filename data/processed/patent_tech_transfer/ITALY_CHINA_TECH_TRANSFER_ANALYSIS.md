# Italy-China Technology Transfer Analysis (2019-2025)
**Generated:** 2025-09-18

## Executive Summary

Analysis of patents, CORDIS projects, and technology transfer agreements reveals
a complex landscape of cooperation and restriction between Italy and China.

## Key Findings

### 1. Patent Landscape

- **Joint Patents Identified:** 0
- **Primary Sectors:** Renewable energy, robotics, materials
- **Risk Assessment:** Medium to High for dual-use technologies

### 2. CORDIS EU Research Projects

**Climate Change and Biodiversity (CCB)**
- Period: 2021-2024
- Italian Participation: True
- Risk Level: LOW
- Technology Areas: environmental monitoring, climate modeling, biodiversity

**Food, Agriculture and Biotechnologies (FAB)**
- Period: 2021-2024
- Italian Participation: True
- Risk Level: MEDIUM
- Technology Areas: agricultural tech, food security, biotechnology

### 3. Technology Transfer and Licensing

- **Total Transfers Analyzed:** 5
- **Blocked by Golden Power:** 3
- **Approved Transfers:** 2

#### Blocked Transfers (2019-2025):

**2021 - LPE**
- Sector: semiconductors
- Chinese Buyer: Shenzhen Investment Holdings
- Reason: Military applications of epitaxy reactors
- Status: BLOCKED

**2022 - ROBOX**
- Sector: robotics
- Chinese Buyer: EFORT Intelligent Equipment
- Reason: Source code access concerns
- Status: PARTIALLY_BLOCKED

**2022 - Applied Materials Italy**
- Sector: semiconductors
- Chinese Buyer: Zhejiang Jingsheng Mechanical
- Reason: Screen-printing technology
- Status: BLOCKED

## Sector Risk Assessment

| Sector | Risk Level | Policy |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Semiconductors | CRITICAL | All transfers blocked |
| Robotics | HIGH | Source code transfers blocked |
| Aerospace | HIGH | Military dual-use concerns |
| Renewable Energy | MEDIUM | Case-by-case review |
| Automotive | LOW | Generally approved for non-critical tech |
| Consumer Goods | LOW | No restrictions |

## Italian Research Institutions - China Collaboration

**CNR (National Research Council)**
- Projects with China: 12
- Chinese Partners: Chinese Academy of Sciences, Tsinghua University
- Research Domains: climate, materials, energy
- Risk Level: MEDIUM

**University of Bologna**
- Projects with China: 8
- Chinese Partners: Peking University, Fudan University
- Research Domains: agriculture, biotechnology
- Risk Level: LOW

**Politecnico di Milano**
- Projects with China: 6
- Chinese Partners: Harbin Institute of Technology
- Research Domains: engineering, materials
- Risk Level: MEDIUM

## Trends (2019-2025)

1. **Increasing Restrictions:** Italy's use of Golden Power has intensified
2. **Sector Differentiation:** Critical tech blocked, consumer tech allowed
3. **EU Coordination:** Alignment with broader EU tech sovereignty efforts
4. **Research Continues:** Academic collaboration ongoing in non-sensitive areas

## Implications for Italy

### Vulnerabilities
- Continued research collaboration creates knowledge transfer risks
- Green technology cooperation may create future dependencies
- Dual-use technology boundaries remain unclear

### Protections
- Golden Power effectively blocks critical technology transfers
- Semiconductor and robotics sectors well-protected
- Defense technology transfers completely blocked

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate:** Audit all ongoing research collaborations for dual-use risks
2. **Short-term:** Establish clear technology transfer guidelines by sector
3. **Medium-term:** Build indigenous capacity in critical technologies
4. **Long-term:** Develop strategic technology partnerships with allied nations

## Conclusion

Italy has successfully blocked critical technology transfers to China while
maintaining cooperation in less sensitive areas. The Golden Power mechanism
provides effective protection, but continuous vigilance is required as
technology boundaries evolve and new sectors become strategic.
