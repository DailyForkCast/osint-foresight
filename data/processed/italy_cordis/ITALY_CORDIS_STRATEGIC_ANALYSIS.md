## Conclusion

Italy demonstrates solid participation in EU research programs but must transition from participant to leader in strategic technologies. The focus should be on:

1. **Leveraging Strengths**: Aerospace, naval, space
2. **Addressing Gaps**: Semiconductors, quantum, AI
3. **Strategic Coordination**: National alignment with EU priorities
4. **Industrial Translation**: From research to capability

The window for action is narrowing as technology leadership crystallizes around key players. Italy must act decisively in Q4 2025 to position for the next wave of EU funding and maintain strategic autonomy.
