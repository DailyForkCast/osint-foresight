        "objective": "As car and truck engines have become quieter and cleaner over the past decades, particulate and noise emissions from road-tyre interaction have become the dominant source of traffic-generated particulate emission and traffic noise. Both particulates (airborne or as microplastics) and noise are suspected to contribute to negative health outcomes for those living near busy roads.\nCurrently, non-exhaust particulate emissions are not regulated. Tyre noise is subject to labelling for passenger vehicl",

Yet there has been no scientific study of digital scores; nor their effect upon creativity and musicianship. This is remarkable for two reasons:  First, because digital scores are generating new music experiences, innovative compositional approaches, novel performance opportunities, and broader accessibility for a vast number of ",
