## Scope & Inputs
- **Country / ISO2:** Austria (AT) · **Years:** 2015–2025 · **Languages:** en, de · **Looser matchers:** ON
- **Primary files (if present):** `data/processed/country=AT/relationships.csv`, `standards_roles.tsv`, `institutions.csv`, `AccreditedLabs.tsv`, `capability_heat.tsv`, `programs.csv`, `international_links.tsv`, `prc_screen.tsv`, `sanctions_hits.csv`, optional `mechanism_incidents.tsv`.
- **Guardrails:** Neutral tone; *signals ≠ proof*. **Exclude US persons entirely** from sanctions/legal references. **MCF detection is label‑independent**: assess **functions** (timing/GNSS, RF/EMC, HPC access, JV/control) even if not labeled MCF.

## B) Scoring Rubric (transparent, simple)
- **Severity (1–3):** potential impact if exploited (1 low, 3 high).
- **Likelihood (L/M/H):** probability given current evidence.
- **Confidence (L/M/H):** evidence quality/quantity and recency.

> Use **multiple anchors** to lift confidence (e.g., accreditation scope **+** standards role **+** program link). If asserting MCF‑consistent risk, cite an **annex/ECCN hook** or mark **"unclear."**

Use 1–5 **Impact** and 1–5 **Likelihood**; compute cell score = Impact × Likelihood. 1–6 = Low, 8–12 = Medium, 15–25 = High. (Keep as a living snapshot.)

| vector_id | impact_1to5 | likelihood_1to5 | cell | band |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| RV2 | 4 | 2 | 8 | Medium
| RV1 | 3 | 2 | 6 | Low
| RV3 | 3 | 2 | 6 | Low
| RV4 | 3 | 1 | 3 | Low
| RV6 | 5 | 1 | 5 | Low

## E) Vignettes (1–5 short narratives)
Write ~120‑word vignettes for the **top 1–5** *prominent or concerning* risks (mix of vectors).

```text
# excel-tsv — data/processed/country=AT/phase6_vignettes.tsv
rank	risk_id	vignette_120w	rationale	evidence_refs
1	R1	Austria's HPC infrastructure access through EuroHPC and VSC represents a dual-edged capability. While enabling legitimate AI/ML research and industrial simulation, this compute power could accelerate development of dual-use models or optimization algorithms. The EU governance framework provides transparency through published allocation policies and project reviews. However, downstream use of allocated compute hours remains difficult to monitor comprehensively. The risk is mitigated by EU export control regulations and facility access logging, though enforcement varies across member states. Austrian institutions' growing expertise in HPC optimization further amplifies both beneficial research outputs and potential misuse scenarios.	Compute access shapes capability horizons	[VSCrunchy_2024, EuroHPC_node]
2	R2	TU Wien's authorship roles in IETF IPPM and NTP working groups provide Austria with standards influence in critical networking infrastructure. While the open IETF process ensures multi-stakeholder review, persistent participation allows gradual steering of technical specifications that affect global deployment practices. Time synchronization protocols underpin numerous sensitive systems from financial networks to GNSS operations. The risk is balanced by IETF's consensus requirements and public draft visibility. However, subtle specification choices can create dependencies or vulnerabilities discoverable only through deep technical analysis. Austria's position enables both constructive contributions and potential strategic positioning.	Standards influence is a soft-power vector	[IPPM_role, NTP_role]
3	R3	Expected EMC/RED testing capabilities in Austria remain undocumented pending accreditation scope capture. These facilities, once confirmed, would enable conformity assessment for radio and electromagnetic compatibility—critical for both consumer products and sensitive systems. The dual-use nature emerges from the same test equipment validating commercial devices and potentially screening for electromagnetic signatures or vulnerabilities. EU RED directives provide a regulatory framework, but implementation varies. Austrian labs' client base and test method specializations will determine actual risk levels. The capability itself is neutral; application context creates risk.	Conformity infrastructure bridges to sensitive domains	[Accreditation_scrape_todo]

## F) Lay Narrative (what we see & why it matters)
Austria's current risk posture is **moderate** and characterized by **capabilities in HPC** and **networking/timing** that enable downstream development, with **expected** but not yet fully documented **RF/EMC** and **time/frequency/GNSS** benches. The most credible near‑term vectors are: (1) **Compute access** shaping model and methods work; (2) **Standards participation** influencing test and deployment practice; and (3) emerging **conformity capabilities** (EMC/GNSS) that can bridge into sensitive systems.

The PRC screen from Phase 5 found **no direct nexus** with PRC entities among Austria's primary collaborators, and **no sanctions hits** were detected in the current network. This clean baseline suggests risks stem more from **capability development** and **knowledge diffusion** rather than problematic partnerships.

Controls are present in principle (export screening, information‑security certifications, national accreditation), but their **operational strength** varies and needs verification beyond policy statements. The EU framework provides substantial governance for HPC access and standards participation, while national accreditation systems ensure technical competence verification.

As evidence accrues, the register will promote or demote risks by **severity, likelihood, and confidence**, with clear citation to the underlying documents, scopes, and rosters. **Sanctions/legal** mentions (EU/UK/CA/AU/NZ/UN) remain **signals‑only** and **exclude US persons**.

---

## G) Sanctions/Legal Overlay (signals‑only; **non‑US persons**)
Current screen shows no EU/UK/CA/AU/NZ/UN sanctions hits among identified Austrian entities or their international partners. Continue monitoring as new relationships emerge.

---

## 3–5 Bullet Executive Summary
- **Most credible vectors:** Compute access (EuroHPC/VSC), standards leverage (IPPM/NTP), and likely RF/EMC & GNSS benches.
- **Risk posture: Moderate** with no PRC nexus or sanctions hits detected; risks stem from capability development rather than problematic partnerships.
- **Controls exist:** EU governance for HPC, IETF open process for standards, national accreditation for testing—operational verification needed.
- **Evidence gaps:** Accreditation scopes for EMC/GNSS labs, LEI/ownership data for suppliers, implementation proof for export controls.
- **Method:** Transparent scoring (severity, likelihood, confidence) with multi‑anchor evidence; label‑independent MCF cues.

## Next Data Boost (1 step)
Capture **10–20 accreditation scopes** in **EMC/RED** and **time/frequency/GNSS** from Akkreditierung Austria, compute **scope_text_hash**, and link labs to clusters. Then refresh **risk_register.tsv** and **phase6_vignettes.tsv** accordingly.
