## 5. METHODOLOGY FRAMEWORK

### 5.1 Data Sources (Free/Available)
- Companies Registration Office (CRO)
- IDA Ireland reports
- Science Foundation Ireland data
- CORDIS (EU projects)
- Patent databases
- Academic publication databases
- Trade statistics (CSO)
- Media monitoring

### 5.2 Analytical Approach
- Network analysis of collaborations
- Patent co-invention mapping
- Investment flow tracking
- Supply chain analysis
- Comparative assessment with peers

### 5.3 Quality Standards
- Multiple source verification
- Confidence levels stated
- Contradictory evidence sought
- Uncertainty quantified
- Limitations acknowledged

## 6. KNOWN CHALLENGES

### 6.1 Data Limitations
- Corporate ownership opacity (holding companies)
- Limited security screening data
- Research collaboration reporting gaps
- Private sector R&D confidentiality

### 6.2 Analytical Challenges
- Distinguishing commercial from strategic intent
- Assessing dual-use potential
- Measuring technology transfer
- Attributing ultimate ownership

## 7. SUCCESS METRICS

### 7.1 Deliverable Quality
- Coverage of key sectors: >80%
- Source verification: >90%
- Confidence levels provided: 100%
- Alternative interpretations: All major findings

### 7.2 Analytical Outcomes
- Risk landscape mapped
- Key vulnerabilities identified
- Comparative context provided
- Trends and patterns clear
- Actionable intelligence delivered

## 8. INITIAL OBSERVATIONS

### 8.1 Preliminary Indicators
- Chinese FDI: €500M-1B (lower than expected)
- Huawei R&D presence noted
- TikTok European HQ in Dublin
- Some university collaborations identified
- Limited public concern expressed

### 8.2 Hypothesis
Ireland shows moderate exposure to research security risks, with concentration in specific sectors (ICT, pharma) but strong existing Western ties providing resilience. Corporate tax structure may obscure ultimate beneficial ownership.

## 9. PHASE PROGRESSION PLAN

### Timeline
- Phase 1: Baseline indicators (2 hours)
- Phase 2: Technology landscape (3 hours)
- Phase 2S: Supply chains (2 hours)
- Phase 3: Network mapping (3 hours)
- Phase 4: Risk assessment (2 hours)
- Phase 5: Collaboration analysis (2 hours)
- Phase 6: Implementation considerations (1 hour)

- Phase 7R: Evidence documentation (1 hour)
- Phase 8: Forward assessment (1 hour)

Total estimated: 18 hours

## 10. KEY DIFFERENTIATORS FROM SLOVAKIA

### Comparative Notes
- Much higher FDI base (US-dominated)
- Stronger existing oversight (IDA screening)
- English language advantage
- EU/US bridge position
- More mature tech ecosystem
- Different risk profile expected
