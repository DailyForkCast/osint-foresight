## Conclusion

Italy's institutional landscape presents a complex security challenge where world-class research capabilities intersect with inadequate oversight of international collaborations. The 287 mapped entities operate in a largely unmonitored environment where Chinese access to sensitive technologies occurs through multiple vectors: conference networking, MoU agreements, talent exchanges, and spin-off acquisitions.

**Critical Findings:**
1. **No Central Registry:** Italy lacks systematic tracking of international research agreements
2. **Conference Vulnerability:** High-risk technology exposure at academic/industry events
3. **Talent Flow Gaps:** Inconsistent vetting of Chinese researchers and students
4. **Spin-off Blindness:** Venture capital screening inadequate for detecting Chinese involvement

**Priority Actions:**
1. **Immediate MoU Registry:** Establish central database within 90 days
2. **Conference Security Protocol:** Deploy monitoring at high-risk events by Q2 2025
3. **Visitor Screening Enhancement:** Implement standardized vetting procedures within 6 months
4. **Spin-off Review Process:** Mandatory security screening for all technology transfers

The current trajectory risks transforming Italy's research excellence into a systematic advantage for Chinese military-civil fusion efforts. Intervention is urgently needed to preserve Italy's technological sovereignty while maintaining beneficial international collaborations.
