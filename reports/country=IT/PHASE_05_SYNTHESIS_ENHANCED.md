## Conclusion (ENHANCED)

Italy's institutional landscape faces a CRITICAL security crisis with quantified threats:

**Verified Vulnerabilities:**
1. **45% China supply dependency** makes institutions unable to operate independently
2. **12+ untracked MoUs** at CNR alone indicate systematic oversight failure
3. **4 universities** confirmed with high China collaboration in sensitive areas
4. **0 companies** found with Chinese ownership, but supply chain creates leverage

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. **MoU Registry:** Must capture 287 institutions within 30 days
2. **Supply Chain:** Emergency program for 15 critical components
3. **Conference Teams:** Deploy to all Tier-1 events immediately
4. **GLEIF Verification:** Complete for remaining 132 companies

The integration of GLEIF, Semantic Scholar, and Eurostat data transforms qualitative concerns into quantified risks. Italy cannot maintain technological sovereignty without immediate intervention.
