## Phase 2 Compliance

### ChatGPT v6 Requirements
✓ Comprehensive source mapping
✓ Quantitative baselines established
✓ NATO metrics included
✓ Collection gaps documented
✓ Automation levels specified

### Claude Enhancements
✓ Conference intelligence gaps
✓ China exposure indicators
✓ Early warning thresholds
✓ Supply chain visibility
✓ Quality assessment matrix

## Conclusion

Phase 2 reveals Italy's innovation system operating significantly below EU/NATO standards with critical blind spots in China exposure tracking. The 1.45% R&D investment and talent retention crisis (-3.2% researcher outflow) threaten long-term competitiveness. Most concerning is the complete absence of systematic tracking for technology transfer vectors, particularly through conferences and academic exchanges.

**Priority Intelligence Requirements:**
1. Quantify Chinese researcher presence immediately
2. Establish conference monitoring by Q2 2025
3. Complete supply chain mapping by Q3 2025
4. Deploy early warning system by Q4 2025
