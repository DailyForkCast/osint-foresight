## National Narratives (Fact-Checked)

### Strategic Positioning
"Italy seeks to balance its role as a founding EU/NATO member with maintaining sovereign industrial capabilities, particularly in defense and space sectors."
- **Evidence:** National Defense Strategy 2022, Space Economy Strategic Plan
- **Confidence:** High

### Technology Sovereignty
"Italy recognizes critical dependencies on foreign technology while investing in domestic capabilities through PNRR and EU recovery funds."
- **Evidence:** €191.5B PNRR allocation, 40% for digital/green transition
- **Confidence:** High

### China Relations Evolution
"Italy's withdrawal from Belt and Road Initiative (2024) signals recalibration of China engagement while maintaining economic ties."
- **Evidence:** Official BRI exit, continued industrial partnerships
- **Confidence:** Medium-High

### Innovation Ecosystem
"Italy's innovation system shows excellence pockets (space, naval) amid overall underinvestment in R&D (1.45% GDP vs 2.3% EU average)."
- **Evidence:** GERD statistics, sector-specific achievements
- **Confidence:** High

## Critical Gaps Identified

### Data Gaps
1. **Quantified Academic Presence:** No reliable data on Chinese researcher numbers
2. **Conference Intelligence:** Limited tracking of technology disclosure at events
3. **Supply Chain Mapping:** Incomplete Tier-2/3 supplier visibility
4. **Funding Transparency:** Hidden beneficial ownership in ventures

### Oversight Gaps
