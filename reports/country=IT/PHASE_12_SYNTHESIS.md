3. **Technology Dependencies:** Critical vulnerabilities in key systems
4. **Human Capital Deficit:** 400+ additional security-cleared personnel needed

**Priority Implementation Actions:**
1. **Immediate:** Establish National Technology Security Authority within 6 months
2. **Short-term:** Deploy conference intelligence and researcher monitoring within 12 months
3. **Medium-term:** Launch quantum and semiconductor independence programs within 24 months
4. **Long-term:** Achieve comprehensive technology security capability within 60 months

Success requires sustained political commitment, adequate resource allocation, and effective coordination with allies. The alternative—continued vulnerability to systematic technology transfer and growing strategic dependence—poses unacceptable risks to national security and alliance relationships.
