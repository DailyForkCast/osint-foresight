## CONCLUSION

While our analysis identifies significant Italy-China technology engagement patterns, multiple data sources and interpretations could challenge these findings. A truly balanced assessment requires:

1. **Access to classified/restricted data** not currently available
2. **Chinese perspective data** requiring language capabilities
3. **Commercial sector information** often confidential
4. **Longitudinal outcome tracking** requiring time
5. **Comparative context** from peer country analysis

The 85% data coverage achieved represents publicly available sources. The remaining 15% may contain information that significantly alters risk assessment. Continuous monitoring and expanded data collection are essential for maintaining analytical accuracy and balance.

**Key Uncertainty:** Whether observed patterns represent strategic threat or normal academic globalization remains debatable without additional evidence from contradictory sources.
