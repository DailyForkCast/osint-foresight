## Conclusion

Italy's institutional landscape presents a paradox: world-class capabilities in critical technologies coupled with significant exposure to Chinese technology acquisition efforts. The "triangle risk" through entities like Leonardo, combined with extensive conference-based networking and weak oversight of international collaborations, creates multiple pathways for sensitive technology transfer.

**Priority Actions:**
1. Immediate Chinese researcher census across all institutions
2. Leonardo triangle risk mitigation strategy
3. Conference monitoring deployment by Q2 2025
4. MoU registry establishment within 90 days

The window for effective intervention is narrowing as China's technology acquisition efforts intensify and Italian institutions expand international collaborations without adequate security frameworks.
