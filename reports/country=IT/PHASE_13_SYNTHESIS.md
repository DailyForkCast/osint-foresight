## Conclusion

The implementation of Italy's technology security transformation represents one of the most comprehensive national security undertakings since the Cold War. Success requires sustained political commitment, adequate resource allocation, effective cross-agency coordination, and strong international partnerships.

**Critical Implementation Findings:**
1. **Immediate Action Required:** Legislative framework must be established within 6 months
2. **Resource Intensity:** €2.3B investment over 5 years essential for success
3. **Coordination Complexity:** 15+ agencies requiring unprecedented cooperation
4. **Allied Integration:** NATO/EU partnerships critical for capability and cost-effectiveness

**Priority Implementation Actions:**
1. **Week 1:** Establish NTSA interim team and begin Chinese researcher census
2. **Month 1:** Launch legislative drafting process for Technology Security Act
3. **Month 3:** Deploy conference intelligence system for immediate threat reduction
4. **Month 6:** Achieve NTSA full operational capability
5. **Year 1:** Demonstrate 50% reduction in unvetted Chinese technology access

The window for effective implementation is closing as Chinese technology acquisition efforts intensify and technological advantages erode. Decisive action in the next 12 months will determine whether Italy emerges as a technology-sovereign NATO leader or becomes increasingly dependent on adversary-controlled systems.

The success or failure of this implementation will serve as a model for other NATO allies facing similar challenges, making Italy's experience critical not only for national security but for the broader Western alliance's technological competitiveness in an era of great power competition.
