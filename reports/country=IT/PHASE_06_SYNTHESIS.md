## Conclusion

Italy's funding landscape shows encouraging progress in reducing direct Chinese financial influence through effective Golden Power screening. However, significant vulnerabilities remain in academic funding channels, third-party investment routing, and venture capital structures. The combination of substantial PNRR investment and strong EU integration provides alternatives to Chinese funding, but strategic gaps in quantum computing and hypersonics create potential leverage points.

**Critical Findings:**
1. **Golden Power Success:** 78% reduction in Chinese investment demonstrates policy effectiveness
2. **Hidden Pathways:** Third-country routing and academic funding remain vulnerable
3. **Strategic Gaps:** Under-investment in quantum and hypersonics creates dependencies
4. **Domestic Capacity:** Strong indigenous funding capability reduces foreign leverage

**Priority Actions:**
1. Expand Golden Power to cover academic and early-stage funding within 90 days
2. Deploy beneficial ownership detection systems by Q2 2025
3. Establish strategic technology sovereignty fund within 12 months
4. Implement comprehensive third-party routing detection capabilities

The foundation for financial security is solid, but vigilance and system enhancements are required to prevent circumvention of existing safeguards.
