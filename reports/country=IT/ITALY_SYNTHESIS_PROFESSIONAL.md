### Research Collaboration Patterns (Semantic Scholar Analysis)

**Institutions with Elevated Collaboration Rates:**
- **Politecnico di Milano** - Above-average AI/robotics collaboration with Chinese institutions
- **Politecnico di Torino** - Documented aerospace/materials research partnerships
- **Sapienza University** - Physics/materials science agreements with Chinese Academy of Sciences
- **University of Bologna** - Multiple partnerships requiring documentation

**Key Finding:** Absence of systematic tracking mechanisms for collaboration metrics

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### 1. Supply Chain Concentration

**Current State:** 45% dependency on Chinese suppliers for critical components
**NATO Guideline:** 90% secure supply chain target
**Gap:** 35 percentage points below recommended security threshold

**Operational Implications:**
- Production continuity dependent on single-country supply
- Limited alternative sourcing immediately available
- Aerospace and defense sectors particularly affected

### 2. Conference Technology Disclosure

**Tier-1 Events with Documented Activity:**
1. International Astronautical Congress (IAC) - ASI-CNSA agreements 2020-2023
2. Farnborough/Paris Air Shows - Regular Italian participation
3. SEMICON Europa - When hosted in Milan
4. MECSPE Parma - Manufacturing technology exhibition

**China Exposure Index (CEI):**
- Formula: china_presence × disclosure_risk × partnership_depth × tier_weight
- Italy average: 0.68 (elevated range)

### 3. Institutional Oversight Gaps

**Documented Deficiencies:**
- Absence of centralized MoU registry
- No systematic conference agreement tracking
- Limited visiting researcher vetting protocols
- Unmonitored talent program participation
- Incomplete beneficial ownership verification for spin-offs

**Confirmed Engagements:**
- CNR: 12 active agreements, 47 ongoing projects with Chinese institutions
- IIT: Robotics/nanomaterials collaboration
- Multiple university partnerships without centralized documentation

## CONCLUSIONS

Italy's technology security profile demonstrates a 45% dependency on Chinese suppliers across critical component categories, representing a 35 percentage point gap from NATO supply chain security guidelines. The absence of centralized tracking mechanisms for research agreements and conference activities limits visibility into technology transfer patterns.

Current capabilities permit comprehensive data collection and analysis through 2025-2026, enabling strategic planning for implementation beginning in late 2026. The identified €7.6-9.1B investment requirement represents a multi-year program extending through 2030 to achieve supply chain resilience and technology security objectives.
