**Classification:** OSINT Synthesis

## Executive Summary

Phase 8 identifies five critical risk scenarios that could compromise Italy's technology security over the next 2-10 years. The assessment reveals that defense spending shortfalls (60-90% probability), technology sovereignty erosion (30-60% probability), and supply chain disruptions (30-60% probability) pose the greatest threats to national security and NATO commitments.

## Risk Scenario Analysis

### Risk 1: Defense Spending Shortfall - CRITICAL

**Mechanism:** Italy fails to meet NATO 2% target → capability gaps worsen → alliance burden-sharing tensions increase → strategic autonomy compromised

| **Impact** | HIGH |
| **Time Horizon** | 2-5 years |
| **Current Status** | 1.46% GDP (below 2% target) |

**Risk Pathway:**
Fiscal constraints → Political resistance → Budget cuts → Capability gaps → Alliance tensions

**Early Warning Indicators:**
- Defense/GDP ratio declining below 1.5%
- Capability gaps exceeding 20 critical areas
- Coalition government instability
- Public opposition to defense spending

**Mitigation Requirements:**
- Immediate political commitment to 2% target
- Multi-year budget protection mechanisms
- Public communication strategy on security needs

### Risk 2: Technology Sovereignty Erosion - HIGH
