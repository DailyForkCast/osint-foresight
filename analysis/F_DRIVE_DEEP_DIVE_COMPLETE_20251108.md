- ✅ National security legal framework (Intelligence Law, Cybersecurity Law, Data Security Law)
- ✅ Recent AI policies (standardization, AI+ opinions)
- ✅ Export control regulations
- ✅ US government analysis and Section 1260H list

### What We're Missing:
- ❌ New Generation AI Development Plan (2017) - **CRITICAL**
- ❌ China Standards 2035 - **CRITICAL**
- ❌ Primary MCF policy document (may be classified)
- ❌ 15th Five Year Plan (not yet released)

### Quality Assessment:
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Excellent** provenance documentation

- ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ **Good** coverage of major policy areas (missing AI Development Plan)
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Excellent** metadata quality

---

**Assessment:** The F: drive contains a high-quality, properly sourced collection of Chinese policy documents with excellent metadata and provenance. The collection is ready for database integration pending acquisition of 2-3 critical missing documents (especially the New Generation AI Development Plan).

**Compliance:** 100% compliant with "no direct .cn access" security requirement.
