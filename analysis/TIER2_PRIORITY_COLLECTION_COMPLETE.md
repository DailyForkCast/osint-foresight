# Tier 2 Priority-Based Personnel Collection - COMPLETE

**Collection Date:** 2025-10-27
**Strategic Approach:** Mission-relevant positions focused on technology policy and innovation
**Zero Fabrication Compliance:** 100% PASS

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully collected **30 strategically critical personnel** across 3 priority tiers, focusing on positions directly relevant to OSINT technology foresight mission rather than comprehensive political coverage.

**Strategic Shift:** User feedback ("make sure that the people and offices we're including are relevant, we don't want to collect information just to do it") led to abandoning comprehensive collection in favor of targeted, mission-relevant positions.

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Strategic Focus Over Comprehensive Coverage:** User feedback shifted approach from "collect all leaders" to "collect mission-relevant positions" - significantly improved signal-to-noise ratio

2. **Economic Significance as Selection Criterion:** For regional collection, focused on largest regional economies (€198B+ GDP) rather than comprehensive coverage of all regions

3. **Institution Name Accuracy Critical:** Database institution names don't always match common usage - must query database first to find exact names before linking personnel

4. **Unicode Encoding Challenges:** Polish (ł, ó), French (é, è), German (ü) characters require try/except ASCII fallback for Windows console output

5. **Role Type Taxonomy:** Intelligence directors require separate role_type ('intelligence') vs political appointments ('political') for proper categorization
