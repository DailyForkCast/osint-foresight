## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Helper function efficiency** - cite(), link(), event(), acq() pattern dramatically speeds data entry
2. **Multi-source from start** - Building with 2-3 sources prevents retroactive enhancement work
3. **Strategic event selection** - Focus on geopolitically significant events (blocks, bans, scandals, partnerships)
4. **Automated verification** - verify_all_countries.py catches issues immediately
5. **Consistent citation format** - APA/Chicago generation ensures academic standards

### Challenges Overcome
1. **UK/GB naming inconsistency** - Event IDs use UK_ but country_code is GB
   - Fixed with special case handling in verification script
2. **Dynamic citation counting** - Summary script now searches for actual record IDs vs. country codes
3. **Source diversity** - Balancing official government sources with credible news coverage

### Best Practices Established
1. **2-3 sources minimum** for all records from inception
2. **Government + news + expert mix** for triangulation
3. **Event-driven documentation** over static descriptions
4. **Geopolitical significance** explicit in every record
5. **Commit verification** after every country addition

---

## Technical Notes

### UK/GB Special Case
The United Kingdom uses:
- **Country code**: GB (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2)
- **Event ID prefix**: UK_ (common usage)

Verification script updated to handle this:
```python
search_prefix = 'UK' if country == 'GB' else country
```

### Citation Link Pattern
All citation links follow pattern: `{COUNTRY_CODE}_{YEAR}_{EVENT_IDENTIFIER}`

Examples:
- FR_2015_alstom
- UK_2020_huawei_ban
- CZ_2020_taiwan_visit
- ES_2022_valencia_port

### Source Reliability Scoring
- **Level 1**: Government documents, official statements
- **Level 2**: Major news organizations (Reuters, FT, BBC), think tanks
- **Level 3**: Company sources, trade publications
- **Level 4**: Unverified sources (NOT USED in this framework)
