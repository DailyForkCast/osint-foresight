## What We Tested

### Dataset 1: USPTO (US-Filed Chinese Patents)
- **Coverage:** 425,074 Chinese patents filed in USPTO
- **Result:** 11.3% growth
- **Represents:** ~10-15% of total Chinese patent activity (international market access)

### Dataset 2: CNIPA (Domestic Chinese Patents)
- **Coverage:** 46,886,314 Chinese patents filed domestically
- **Result:** 135.4% growth overall
- **Represents:** ~85-90% of total Chinese patent activity (domestic market)

### Dataset 3: CNIPA Semiconductors (CPC H01L)
- **Coverage:** 2,847,563 semiconductor device patents
- **Result:** -3.0% growth (DECLINED!)

## Key Findings

### 1. Geographic Scope is Critical

**CNIPA shows 12x higher growth than USPTO:**
- CNIPA: 135.4%
- USPTO: 11.3%
- Ratio: 12:1

**Interpretation:** Made in China 2025 had MUCH stronger impact on domestic filing than international filing.

**Filing strategy shifted toward domestic:**
- Pre-policy: 97.6% filed in CNIPA, 2.4% in USPTO
- Post-policy: 98.9% filed in CNIPA, 1.1% in USPTO
- China became MORE inward-focused after policy

---

### 2. Semiconductor Paradox

**Semiconductors were highest priority but showed NEGATIVE growth:**

**Policy Priority Rankings:**
1. Semiconductors: 7 high-priority mentions (HIGHEST)
2. Aerospace: 6 mentions
3. Robotics: 6 mentions
4. Telecommunications: 6 mentions

**Yet Patent Growth:**
- Semiconductors (H01L): **-3.0%** (declined!)
- Overall CNIPA: +135.4% (grew)
- Advanced IT: +147.3% (grew more)

**Market Share Collapse:**
- Pre-policy: 12.1% of CNIPA patents were semiconductors
- Post-policy: 5.0% of CNIPA patents were semiconductors
- Drop: -7.1 percentage points

**Possible Explanations:**
1. **Patent classification drift** - Modern chips classified as AI (G06N) or telecom (H04L), not semiconductors (H01L)
2. **Manufacturing focus** - Building fabs, not inventing new technologies
3. **Trade secrets** - Protecting innovations as confidential, not filing patents
4. **Technology import** - Using foreign IP rather than developing domestic
5. **Quality over quantity** - Fewer but higher-value patents (not tested)

---

### 3. Advanced IT Sector Showed Highest Growth (But Still Not 340%)

**Advanced IT = Semiconductors + AI + Telecom + Big Data + Cloud**

**Growth: 147.3%**
- Pre-policy: 608,206 patents/year
- Post-policy: 1,504,110 patents/year
- Absolute increase: 895,904 patents/year

**Sector-Specific Boost:**
- Advanced IT: 147.3%
- Overall CNIPA: 135.4%
- Outperformance: +11.9 percentage points

**Market Share:**
- Pre-policy: 37.4% of all CNIPA patents
- Post-policy: 39.3% of all CNIPA patents
- Change: +1.9 percentage points (modest increase)

---

### 4. Scale of Chinese Patent Activity

**CNIPA dominates Chinese patent activity (110:1 ratio vs USPTO):**

```
Total Chinese Patents (2011-2025):
- CNIPA:  46,886,314 patents (98.9%)
- USPTO:     425,074 patents (1.1%)
- Ratio:     110:1
```

**This confirms:**
- China files overwhelmingly domestically
- International patents (USPTO) are tiny fraction
- Made in China 2025 targeted domestic market, not global

## Where Did the "340%" Claim Likely Come From?

### Updated Hypothesis Rankings (After CNIPA Testing)

**1. Wrong Methodology (Grant Dates vs Filing Dates) - HIGH (⭐⭐⭐⭐)**
- Most common error in patent analysis
- Grant dates inflate post-policy counts (2.5 year lag)
- Could add 50-150% artificial growth
- Combined with CNIPA (135%) could reach ~285% (still short)

**2. Cherry-Picked Sub-Technology - HIGH (⭐⭐⭐⭐)**
- Very specific CPC classification with small baseline
- E.g., EUV lithography, AI chip packaging, quantum processors
- Small N → large percentage increase
- May be technically true but misleadingly narrow

**3. Different Time Period - MEDIUM (⭐⭐⭐)**
- 2015-2020 (first 5 years) might show steeper spike
- Or 2018-2023 (excluding policy lag and COVID impact)
- Peak growth period vs. full period average

**4. Cumulative vs Annualized Growth - MEDIUM (⭐⭐⭐)**
- We calculated: annualized rate growth (135%)
- Claim might be: cumulative total growth
- CNIPA total patents: 7M (pre) → 39.8M (post) = 464% cumulative
- But this confuses duration effect with policy effect

**5. Regional / Institution-Specific - LOW (⭐⭐)**
- E.g., Shenzhen only, or state-owned enterprises only
- Specific geographic or ownership category
- Would be very misleading if presented as national figure

**6. Projection/Forecast - LOW (⭐)**
- Claim is aspirational target, not actual achievement
- "By 2025, patents will have grown 340%"
- Actual achievement fell short of forecast

**7. CNIPA + Semiconductors - REJECTED (❌)**
- We tested this directly
- CNIPA overall: 135%
- Semiconductors: -3%
- Cannot reach 340%

**8. USPTO - REJECTED (❌)**
- Showed only 11.3% growth
- Cannot explain 340% under any scenario

## What We Know with High Confidence

### ✅ Confirmed Findings

1. **USPTO Growth: 11.3%**
   - Based on 425,074 patents, 2011-2020
   - Filing dates methodology (correct)
   - No immediate spike after 2015
   - Largest jump in 2019 (trade war year, not policy year)

2. **CNIPA Growth: 135.4%**
   - Based on 46.9M patents, 2011-2025
   - Filing dates methodology (correct)
   - 12x higher than USPTO
   - Shows Made in China 2025 had domestic focus

3. **Advanced IT Outperformed Overall: 147.3%**
   - Highest growth among priority sectors tested
   - +11.9 pp above overall CNIPA
   - Modest sector-specific boost

4. **Semiconductors Declined: -3.0%**
   - Despite being highest policy priority
   - Market share dropped from 12.1% to 5.0%
   - Paradoxical finding requiring explanation

5. **Domestic Filing Intensified**
   - CNIPA share: 97.6% → 98.9%
   - USPTO share: 2.4% → 1.1%
   - China became MORE inward-focused post-policy

### ❌ Rejected Hypotheses

1. **340% applies to USPTO** - Rejected (showed only 11.3%)
2. **340% applies to overall CNIPA** - Rejected (showed 135.4%)
3. **340% applies to CNIPA semiconductors** - Rejected (showed -3.0%)
4. **340% applies to CNIPA Advanced IT** - Rejected (showed 147.3%)

### ⚠️ Untested Scenarios (Remaining Possibilities)

1. **Grant dates methodology** (wrong but common)
2. **Specific sub-technology** (narrow CPC code with small baseline)
3. **Different time period** (2015-2020 vs 2015-2025)
4. **Cumulative growth** (total increase vs annualized rate)
5. **Other MIC2025 sectors** (robotics, aerospace, new energy vehicles)
6. **Regional/institutional subset** (Shenzhen, SOEs, etc.)

## Strategic Implications

### If 340% Claim is Exaggerated

**China's patent growth is REAL but MODEST:**
- 135% CNIPA growth is substantial (not trivial)
- But not the explosive "340%" suggested
- Policy had measurable but not transformative impact

**Semiconductors are a WEAKNESS, not strength:**
- Highest policy priority but negative patent growth
- Suggests manufacturing focus over innovation
- Supports narrative of China's semiconductor vulnerability

**Made in China 2025 drove DOMESTIC focus:**
- International patent filings barely increased (11%)
- Domestic filings more than doubled (135%)
- Strategy prioritizes China market, not global

### If 340% Claim is True for Specific Area

**Would indicate highly targeted success:**
- Overall growth modest (135%)
- But specific technology/region/institution grew 340%
- Cherry-picking hides broader picture

**Would raise questions:**
- Why not disclosed with qualifications?
- What specific area achieved this?
- Is it sustainable or one-time spike?

## Conclusion

**After comprehensive analysis of 47+ million Chinese patents across USPTO and CNIPA databases, the "340% patent growth following Made in China 2025" claim is NOT confirmed in any major dataset or technology category tested.**

**The highest growth found was 147.3% (CNIPA Advanced IT sector), which is substantial but falls 192.7 percentage points short of the 340% claim.**

**The claim most likely originates from:**
1. Methodological error (grant dates vs filing dates)
2. Cherry-picked sub-technology with small baseline
3. Different time period or measurement approach
4. Exaggeration or misinterpretation of actual data

**What IS confirmed:**
- China's domestic patent filings grew 135% (substantial)
- Made in China 2025 had MUCH stronger impact domestically than internationally (135% vs 11%)
- Semiconductors paradoxically DECLINED despite being highest priority (-3%)
- China shifted even MORE toward domestic filing after policy (98.9% domestic post-policy vs 97.6% pre-policy)

**Recommendation:** Document the 340% claim as unsubstantiated by rigorous analysis of comprehensive patent datasets. The actual growth of 135% (CNIPA) is still substantial and noteworthy, but should be reported accurately.
