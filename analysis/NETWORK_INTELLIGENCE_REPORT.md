## INTELLIGENCE INSIGHTS

1. **Network Structure**: The network shows clear clustering around technology domains
2. **Risk Concentration**: High-risk entities tend to cluster together
3. **Bridge Entities**: Key entities connecting different clusters represent critical intelligence targets
4. **Hidden Paths**: Multiple indirect pathways exist between seemingly unconnected entities

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

1. Monitor bridge entities for early warning of technology transfer
2. Investigate clusters with high average risk scores
3. Map hidden connection paths for all critical entities
4. Track changes in centrality metrics over time
