## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Streamlined Python scripts** - Quick population approach efficient for new countries
2. **Schema consistency** - Using existing bilateral_countries/bilateral_events tables
3. **Multi-source from start** - Italy/Poland/Netherlands had 100% coverage immediately
4. **Automated citation generation** - APA/Chicago formatting reduced manual work
5. **Event-focused approach** - Bilateral events more comprehensive than just acquisitions

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Schema mismatches** - Fixed by checking PRAGMA table_info first
2. **KraussMaffei duplicate** - Citation link pointed to non-existent record ID
3. **Column name variations** - Different tables have different field names (verification_status vs no such column)

### Best Practices Established
1. Always check table schema with PRAGMA before bulk inserts
2. Start with 2-3 sources per record from beginning (easier than retroactive enhancement)
3. Focus on geopolitically significant events (blocks, restrictions, policy shifts)
4. Mix official government + major news + expert analysis for triangulation
5. Document strategic significance explicitly in event records
