## 💡 Strategic Insights (Preliminary)

### Finding 1: Intelligence Agencies Lead Policy Hardening

**Observation:** The most critical China stances come from intelligence/security agencies (BfV, BND, BSI) rather than economic ministries.

**Implication:** German China policy increasingly security-driven, not economics-driven. This represents a fundamental shift from the Merkel era.

**Evidence:**
- BfV President Haldenwang "very critical" stance
- BSI 5G security requirements
- Public warnings on espionage (unprecedented transparency)

---

### Finding 2: Coalition Government Enables Values-Based Policy

**Observation:** Green party ministers (Baerbock, Habeck) driving shift to values-based China policy.

**Implication:** German China policy now more aligned with EU consensus and US approach than under previous government.

**Evidence:**
- Foreign Minister Baerbock's human rights focus
- Economy Minister Habeck's "de-risking" strategy
- Departure from Merkel's engagement-first approach

---

### Finding 3: Policy Consistency Across Institutions

**Observation:** Despite different portfolios, all key officials show "critical" or "very critical" stances.

**Implication:** German China policy has achieved rare cross-institutional consensus. This makes policy reversals less likely.

**Evidence:**
- Foreign Affairs: Critical
- Economics: Moderate (de-risking)
- Defense: Critical
- Intelligence: Very Critical
- Cybersecurity: Critical

### What Needs Improvement:

⚠️ **Automated Collection:** Need web scrapers for official websites
⚠️ **Multi-Language:** Translation pipelines for non-English content
