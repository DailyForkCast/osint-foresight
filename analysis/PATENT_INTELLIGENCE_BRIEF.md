## ANOMALY DETECTION WITH MUNDANE EXPLANATIONS

### Pattern Recognition
- EPO publishes on Wednesdays
- USPTO publishes on Tuesdays
- Munich office publishes on Thursdays
- End-of-month surges are NORMAL
- Pre-holiday filing surges are EXPECTED

### Recent Anomaly Analysis

## KEY INTELLIGENCE INSIGHTS

1. **Patent Surges**: Most surges have mundane explanations (publishing schedules, holidays)
2. **True Anomalies**: Only flag patterns that deviate from known schedules
3. **Technology Focus**: Monitor specific technology categories, not just companies
4. **Access Method**: Use Google Patents to avoid accessing Chinese sites directly

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

1. Check the provided URLs weekly for new patents
2. Only investigate anomalies WITHOUT mundane explanations
3. Focus on dual-use technology patents
4. Track technology categories, not just companies
5. Remember: Thursday surges from Munich are NORMAL
