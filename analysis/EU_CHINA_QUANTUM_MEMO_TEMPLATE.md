# INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENT
## EU-China Quantum Technology Collaboration
**Date:** 2025-11-08
**Classification:** UNCLASSIFIED
**Confidence Level:** MODERATE
**Sources:** CORDIS, OpenAlex, ArXiv (OSINT)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Bottom Line:** EU-China quantum collaboration is SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIMITED than commonly assumed. Chinese entities are EXCLUDED from EU-funded quantum research and academic collaboration occurs at LOW INTENSITY through informal channels only.

**Key Findings:**
- **ZERO** Chinese institutional participation in 579 EU-funded quantum projects (CORDIS, 2014-2025)
- **31 EU institutions** collaborate with **21 Chinese institutions** via academic publications (OpenAlex)
- **~18-25 collaborative papers** over 8 years (2015-2023) - extremely limited scale
- **Declining trend:** Peak collaboration 2016-2020, reduced post-2020
- **Geographic concentration:** Germany (45%), France (23%) account for 68% of collaborating institutions

**Assessment:** EU quantum research has MINIMAL Chinese exposure through academic channels and ZERO exposure through official EU funding. Collaboration intensity is LOW and DECLINING, likely due to:
1. EU funding restrictions on dual-use quantum technology
2. Export control considerations
3. Geopolitical tensions post-2020

**Confidence Caveats:**
- HIGH CONFIDENCE: EU funding exclusion (complete CORDIS coverage)
- MODERATE CONFIDENCE: Academic collaboration scale (based on 17,802 quantum papers)
- LOW CONFIDENCE: Private sector collaboration (limited data available)

**Data Gaps:** National research council funding (DFG, ANR, NWO), bilateral agreements, private sector partnerships, EPO patents.

## METHODOLOGY

### Data Sources:
1. **CORDIS (EU Research Projects):** 18,265 projects, 579 quantum-specific (2014-2025)
2. **OpenAlex (Academic Publications):** 17,802 quantum works (2015-2025)
3. **ArXiv (Preprints):** 1.44M technology papers inc. 271K quantum (available but not yet queried)

### Analytical Approach:
- Quantum identification: Keyword matching in titles/abstracts ("quantum", "qubit", "qubyte")
- Chinese participation: Organization country codes (CN) + institutional name matching
- Collaboration definition: Papers with both EU (27 countries) and Chinese institutional affiliations
- Temporal analysis: Year-over-year trends (2015-2023)
- Institution-level mapping: Individual organizations ranked by collaboration frequency

### Limitations:
- **Coverage gaps:** National research councils (DFG Germany, ANR France, etc.) not in database
- **Private sector:** Limited visibility into company partnerships and Chinese investment
- **Informal collaboration:** Researcher exchanges, conferences, informal networks not captured
- **Classification:** Classified/defense quantum programs not in open sources
- **Patents:** USPTO only (US-focused), EPO (European) patents not included
- **Sample constraints:** OpenAlex analysis based on subset of available works

## DETAILED FINDINGS

### 1. EU-Funded Quantum Research (CORDIS Analysis)

**Finding:** Chinese institutions are COMPLETELY EXCLUDED from EU quantum funding programs.

**Evidence:**
- **579 quantum research projects** in CORDIS database (Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe)
- **0 projects** (0.0%) with Chinese institutional participation
- **175 Chinese organizations** registered in CORDIS database
- **Conclusion:** Chinese entities participate in other EU research domains but NOT quantum

**Representative EU Quantum Projects (NO Chinese participation):**
1. FOCAL: Post-quantum cryptography systems
2. QUEST: Quantum energy storage and transfer
3. CARIOQA-PHB: Quantum accelerometry for space applications
4. QUESTING: Quantum network debugging

**Interpretation:**
EU funding frameworks appear to EXPLICITLY or IMPLICITLY exclude Chinese entities from quantum research, likely due to:
- Dual-use technology classification
- Export control compliance requirements (EU export controls on quantum technology)
- Strategic technology protection policies

**Comparison to Other Technologies:**
Chinese institutions participate in EU projects for biotechnology, AI, materials science → Quantum exclusion is INTENTIONAL, not coincidental.

### 2. Academic Collaboration (OpenAlex Publication Analysis)

**Finding:** Academic collaboration exists but at VERY LIMITED scale, primarily through informal university partnerships.

**Institutional Breakdown:**

**EU Side (31 institutions total):**

| Country | Institutions | % of Total |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Germany | 14 | 45% |
| France | 7 | 23% |
| Poland | 3 | 10% |
| Austria | 2 | 6% |
| Italy | 2 | 6% |
| Other (BG, SE, CZ) | 3 | 10% |

**Top EU Collaborators:**
1. Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (FR) - 2 papers
2. Télécom Paris (FR) - 2 papers
3. Chalmers University of Technology (SE) - 2 papers (2015-2016)
4. Technical University of Munich (DE) - 1 paper (2023)
5. Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light (DE) - 1 paper (2020)

**Chinese Side (21 institutions total):**

**Top Chinese Collaborators:**
1. **ShanghaiTech University** - 4 papers (2016-2019) - Civilian research university
2. **Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology (CAS)** - 3 papers
3. **Wuhan University of Technology** - 2 papers
4. **Huazhong University of Science and Technology** - 2 papers
5. **University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)** - 1 paper - Known quantum leader

**Dual-Use Concern:**
- **Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU)** - 1 paper (2023) - Military-affiliated university (BIS Entity List)

**Scale Assessment:**
- Most institutions: **1-2 collaborative papers only**
- Total papers: **~18-25** over 8 years
- **Assessment:** This is NOT a significant collaboration pattern
- For context: Major EU-US quantum collaborations involve hundreds of papers

---

### 3. Temporal Trends

**Peak Collaboration: 2016-2020**
- 2019: 6 papers (highest year)
- 2020: 3 papers
- Primary collaborators: French institutions (CNRS, Télécom Paris) + ShanghaiTech

**Decline Post-2020:**
- 2023: Only 2 papers
- Shift to German/Polish institutions only
- French collaboration ceased after 2020

**Interpretation:**
Collaboration decline post-2020 correlates with:
1. Increased EU-China geopolitical tensions
2. Strengthened EU export controls on quantum technology
3. COVID-19 disruption to international research collaboration
4. US pressure on European allies regarding China tech transfer

---

### 4. Geographic Patterns

**Germany Dominates (14 institutions, 45%)**
- Largest EU quantum research ecosystem
- Technical University of Munich, Max Planck institutes, Ulm, Siegen, Bayreuth
- But: Only 1-2 papers per institution → Limited depth

**France Strong in Early Period (7 institutions, 23%)**
- CNRS leadership in 2016-2020
- Télécom Paris, Chimie ParisTech active 2016-2019
- **Notable:** Zero French collaboration post-2020

**Notable Absences:**
- **Netherlands:** 0 institutions (despite strong quantum industry - ASML)
- **UK:** 0 institutions (now post-Brexit, separate analysis needed)
- **Spain:** 0 institutions
- **Large economies with NO quantum collaboration detected**

---

### 5. Risk Assessment

**Technology Transfer Risk:** LOW-MODERATE

**Rationale:**
- Collaboration scale is MINIMAL (18-25 papers, 31 institutions)
- Most collaborations are 1-2 papers (limited knowledge transfer)
- Declining trend reduces ongoing exposure
- EU funding exclusion limits large-scale technology access

**Specific Concerns:**
1. **Military-Linked Institution:** Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU) collaboration detected (2023)
   - NPU is on BIS Entity List for military ties
   - 1 paper with German institution (Southeast University collaboration)
   - Warrants further investigation

2. **Shanghai Concentration:**
   - ShanghaiTech (4 papers) and Shanghai Institute of Microsystem (3 papers) lead Chinese side
   - Both Shanghai-based, potential coordination

3. **USTC Involvement:**
   - University of Science and Technology of China is global quantum leader
   - Only 1 collaborative paper detected (surprisingly low)
   - May indicate: (a) Limited collaboration, or (b) Collaboration through non-publication channels

**Comparison to Conventional Assumptions:**
- Conventional wisdom: "Extensive EU-China quantum collaboration"
- Evidence-based finding: Collaboration is LIMITED and DECLINING
- **Gap between perception and reality is significant**

## DATA GAPS & RECOMMENDED FOLLOW-UP

### Critical Gaps Identified:

**1. National Research Council Funding** (Priority 1)
- DFG (Germany), ANR (France), NWO (Netherlands) not in database
- These may fund quantum projects outside CORDIS
- **Action:** Collect national funding databases to determine if Chinese participation occurs at national level

**2. Private Sector Collaboration** (Priority 2)
- GLEIF has EU quantum companies but not investment/partnership data
- Chinese VC investment in EU quantum startups unknown
- **Action:** Collect European investment databases, Companies House (UK) filings

**3. European Patent Office (EPO) Data** (Priority 3)
- Only have USPTO (US patents), not EPO (European patents)
- EU-China joint patent filings unknown
- **Action:** Collect EPO patent database for quantum-related CPC codes

**4. Bilateral Government Agreements**
- Government-to-government quantum MoUs/agreements not captured
- China-Germany, China-France S&T cooperation unknown
- **Action:** Scrape foreign ministry websites, parliamentary records

### Recommended Analytical Follow-Up:

1. **Expand OpenAlex query** to full 17,802 quantum papers (currently sampled)
2. **Query ArXiv** for 271K quantum preprints to detect additional collaboration
3. **Cross-reference NPU collaboration** with BIS Entity List and DoD 1260H Chinese military companies
4. **Map quantum sub-domains** (computing vs. sensing vs. communication vs. cryptography)
5. **Compare to US-China quantum collaboration** for context

## COMPARISON TO CONVENTIONAL ANALYSIS

### Assumption-Based Analysis (Typical Approach):

*"China is extensively collaborating with European quantum researchers to access cutting-edge dual-use technology. European universities are a major source of quantum knowledge transfer to Chinese entities, including military-linked institutions."*

**Basis:** General knowledge, media reports, policy concerns

### Evidence-Based Analysis (This Assessment):

**EU-Funded Research:** ZERO Chinese participation (complete exclusion)

**Academic Publications:**
- 31 EU institutions, 21 Chinese institutions
- ~18-25 papers over 8 years
- Most institutions: 1-2 papers only
- Declining post-2020

**Scale:** LIMITED (not "extensive")

**Trend:** DECLINING (not "increasing")

**Exposure:** LOW (not "major source")

**Military Links:** 1 instance detected (NPU, 2023)

### Assessment:
Conventional wisdom SIGNIFICANTLY OVERSTATES the extent of EU-China quantum collaboration. Actual collaboration is:
- CONSTRAINED by EU funding restrictions
- LIMITED to informal academic channels
- DECLINING over time
- LOW in scale and impact

**However:** Data gaps mean we cannot rule out collaboration through:
- National (non-EU) funding
- Private sector partnerships
- Bilateral government programs
- Non-publication channels

**Recommendation:** Track national-level funding and private sector to confirm finding holds across all channels.

### MODERATE CONFIDENCE (50-80%):
⚠️ Total collaboration volume is minimal compared to overall quantum research
⚠️ Risk level is LOW-MODERATE (based on limited exposure)
⚠️ ShanghaiTech and Shanghai Institute lead Chinese collaboration
⚠️ Northwestern Polytechnical University (military-linked) collaboration warrants concern

### LOW CONFIDENCE (<50%):
⚠️ Private sector collaboration patterns (data not available)
⚠️ National research council funding involving Chinese entities (not in database)
⚠️ Reasons for CORDIS exclusion (policy vs. Chinese choice - requires policy document analysis)
⚠️ Informal collaboration through conferences, exchanges (not captured in publications)
