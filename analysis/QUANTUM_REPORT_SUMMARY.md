## Risk Assessment Summary

### Risk Distribution

- **LOW Risk**: 2 countries (Spain, Poland - ~14% collab rate)
- **MINIMAL Risk**: 17 countries (including all major research hubs)

### Critical Insight

**No HIGH or CRITICAL risk countries identified.** The current dataset shows relatively low China collaboration in European quantum research compared to other scientific domains. However, this may reflect:

1. **Dataset limitations**: OpenAlex coverage may be incomplete
2. **Publication lag**: Recent collaborations not yet published
3. **Non-publication channels**: Equipment transfers, consulting not captured
4. **Strategic sensitivity**: Some quantum research may be classified

### Tier 1 Leaders

1. **Germany**: 36 works | 2 China collabs (5.6%) | 1,338 citations
2. **United Kingdom**: 20 works | 2 China collabs (10.0%) | 1,006 citations
3. **Switzerland**: 16 works | 0 China collabs (0.0%) | 2,648 citations
4. **France**: 12 works | 0 China collabs (0.0%) | 541 citations
5. **Italy**: 10 works | 0 China collabs (0.0%) | 319 citations

### Key Observation

**Switzerland** has the highest research impact (2,648 citations / 16 works = 165.5 avg citations per work) with zero detected China collaboration, suggesting strong independent quantum research capability.

## Technology Focus Areas

### Top Quantum Research Topics

1. **Quantum and electron transport phenomena**: 18 works
2. **Quantum Information and Cryptography**: 17 works
3. **Semiconductor Quantum Structures and Devices**: 12 works
4. **Quantum Computing Algorithms and Architecture**: 8 works
5. **Quantum Dots Synthesis And Properties**: 7 works

### Dual-Use Concerns

The research topics indicate significant work in:
- **Quantum cryptography** (military secure communications)
- **Quantum computing algorithms** (cryptanalysis potential)
- **Quantum sensing devices** (submarine detection applications)

---

## Strategic Implications

### 1. Lower Than Expected Collaboration Rate

The **6.5% China collaboration rate** is surprisingly low compared to other technology domains, suggesting:

- Quantum research may be subject to existing informal security protocols
- Researchers may be aware of technology transfer sensitivities
- European institutions may already be exercising caution
- OR dataset coverage is incomplete (major concern)

### 2. Germany and UK as Primary Collaboration Nodes

Both Germany (2 collabs) and UK (2 collabs) account for **57% of all detected China collaborations** despite having only minimal risk levels due to their large research bases.

### 3. Small Country Vulnerability

**Austria's 50% collaboration rate** (albeit from only 2 works) highlights vulnerability in smaller quantum research communities where a single collaboration significantly impacts the ratio.

### 4. Swiss Model

Switzerland's combination of high-impact research (2,648 citations) with zero China collaboration may represent a model for maintaining research excellence while managing technology transfer risks.

## Immediate Recommendations

### Policy Level

1. **Validate Dataset Completeness**: Verify OpenAlex coverage of European quantum research
2. **Expand Data Sources**: Integrate CORDIS, national research databases, patent filings
3. **Establish Baseline Monitoring**: Track collaboration trends over time
4. **EU-Wide Standards**: Develop harmonized research security protocols

### Institutional Level

1. **Enhanced Screening for High-Rate Countries**: Austria, Spain, Poland require focused attention
2. **Volume Monitoring for Major Hubs**: Germany and UK need monitoring despite low rates
3. **Researcher Education**: Mandatory security awareness for quantum scientists
4. **Technology Classification**: Review and classify sensitive quantum research areas

### Operational Level

1. **Track Non-Publication Channels**: Equipment, materials, consulting arrangements
2. **Monitor Researcher Mobility**: Visiting scholars, conference participation
3. **Review Funding Sources**: Identify foreign funding of European quantum research
4. **Patent Analysis**: Track quantum technology patent filings and assignments

## Data Quality Notes

### Strengths

- Comprehensive temporal coverage (1979-2024)
- Author-level affiliation data enabling collaboration detection
- Citation metrics for impact assessment
- 30 distinct research topic classifications

### Limitations

- **Small Sample Size**: Only 107 works identified (expected: thousands)
- **Institution Data Gap**: No institution names populated (query error)
- **Possible Undercounting**: OpenAlex coverage of quantum research unclear
- **Publication Lag**: 2024-2025 collaborations not yet captured
- **Non-Publication Transfers**: Equipment, consulting, industrial partnerships not included

### Recommended Follow-Up

1. **Query Optimization**: Expand keyword list, search additional fields
2. **CORDIS Integration**: Cross-reference with EU project database (2,610 projects available)
3. **Patent Analysis**: Include USPTO, EPO quantum patent collaborations
4. **Conference Proceedings**: Add IEEE, APS quantum conference publications
5. **Preprint Servers**: Search arXiv quantum categories

## Conclusion: Highest China Collaboration Countries

**Based on collaboration rate (percentage of quantum works with China co-authorship):**

1. **Austria**: 50.0% (1/2 works) - MODERATE risk, requires monitoring
2. **Spain**: 14.3% (1/7 works) - LOW risk, notable presence
3. **Poland**: 14.3% (1/7 works) - LOW risk, baseline monitoring
4. **United Kingdom**: 10.0% (2/20 works) - MINIMAL risk, volume concern
5. **Germany**: 5.6% (2/36 works) - MINIMAL risk, volume concern

**Key Takeaway**: Despite Germany and UK having the highest absolute volumes of China collaboration (2 works each), Austria has the highest collaboration RATE due to its small quantum research base. For research security planning:

- **Monitor Austria, Spain, Poland** for high collaboration rates
- **Monitor Germany, UK** for absolute volumes despite low rates
- **Learn from Switzerland, France, Italy** with zero detected collaborations
- **Expand data collection** - current dataset likely undercounts actual collaboration

The relatively low overall 6.5% China collaboration rate (compared to 20-40% in other scientific domains) may indicate either effective informal security protocols already in place, OR significant dataset coverage gaps requiring further investigation.
