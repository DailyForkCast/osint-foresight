- UK continuation funding post-£1B initial phase
- Specific workforce size/deficit quantification
- Quantum-specific allocations in multiple national programmes
- Future projection uncertainties explicitly noted

**Unavailable Sources Documented:** 7 specific sources
1. Crunchbase (paywall)
2. CBInsights (paywall)
3. Pitchbook (paywall)
4. China quantum programme detailed budgets
5. US agency-specific appropriations detail
6. OpenAlex analysis (in progress)
7. MERICS Quantum Report 2024 PDF (file access issue)

**Conclusion:** All data gaps explicitly acknowledged; no speculation presented as fact.

---

### Test 6: Narrative Word Count ✅ PASSED
**Objective:** Ensure narrative synthesis ≤2,500 words

**Result:** 2,487 words (99.5% of limit)

**Conclusion:** Within specified length while maintaining comprehensive coverage.

## LIMITATIONS AND CAVEATS

### Data Limitations Acknowledged:

1. **OpenAlex academic analysis incomplete**
   - Background search initiated but not finished at report generation time
   - Preliminary CORDIS results provide EU academic perspective
   - US and China academic output metrics pending

2. **Paywall-restricted sources**
   - Crunchbase, CBInsights, Pitchbook unavailable
   - Partial private investment data from public announcements
   - May undercount private sector quantum funding

3. **National programme budget details**
   - China quantum-specific allocation within 3.6T yuan total R&D undisclosed
   - US NQI agency-by-agency appropriations not publicly detailed in FY2025 supplement
   - Some EU member state contributions to Quantum Flagship not itemized

4. **Long-term projections inherently uncertain**
   - 2045 forecasts extrapolated from 2025-2035 verified targets
   - Technology development may accelerate or face unforeseen barriers
   - Geopolitical factors could alter national priorities

### Mitigation Strategies Applied:

- All limitations explicitly documented in JSON "unavailable_sources" section
- Alternative data sources used where possible (public announcements vs. paywalled databases)
- Long-term projections clearly marked as extrapolations with stated basis
- Uncertainty levels noted throughout long_term_2045 section
