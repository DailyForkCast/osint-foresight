2. **Foundry Gap:** SMIC 709 patents across 10 years vs. TSMC's thousands annually. Manufacturing technology gap cannot be closed via patents alone - requires equipment, materials, and process expertise.

3. **Memory Progress:** YMTC 439 patents in 3 years shows rapid catch-up possible in memory (vs. logic). Memory architecture changes (2D → 3D NAND) created new opportunity window China exploited.

4. **Packaging Opportunity:** 3,056 packaging patents (13% of total) reflects China's strategy to bypass leading-edge node limitations through advanced packaging (chiplets, 3D stacking).

### Post-2020 Outlook (Data Gap)

**Database limitation:** No data post-2020, missing critical period:
- **2022: CHIPS Act** ($52B US investment)
- **2022: Enhanced Export Controls** (October 2022 comprehensive restrictions)
- **2022-2023:** YMTC, CXMT equipment restrictions
- **2023: Netherlands/Japan** join US semiconductor equipment export controls

**Expected 2021-2025 Trends:**
- **Manufacturing patents:** Decline (equipment access restricted)
- **Design patents:** Increase (focus on non-restricted areas)
- **RISC-V patents:** Surge (open architecture, no US licensing)
- **Advanced packaging:** Surge (strategic priority to bypass node limitations)
- **AI accelerator patents:** Surge (Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei alternatives to NVIDIA)
