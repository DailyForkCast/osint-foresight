cd "C:/Projects/OSINT - Foresight"

# 2. Create collector for Eastern EU
cp scripts/terminal_a_eu_major_collector.py scripts/terminal_b_eastern_collector.py

# 3. Modify for your countries and run
# START WITH HUNGARY - highest China exposure

# 4. Check Hungary specifically
python -c "
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('F:/OSINT_WAREHOUSE/osint_research.db')
cursor = conn.execute('''
    SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(has_chinese_partner)
    FROM core_f_collaboration
    WHERE source_file LIKE '%HU%' OR source_file LIKE '%Hungary%'
''')
print('Hungary results:', cursor.fetchone())
"

        SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(has_chinese_partner)
        FROM core_f_collaboration
        WHERE source_file LIKE '%{country}%'
    ''')

# Add geopolitical context in analyst_notes
conn.execute("""
    INSERT INTO research_session (
        session_id, research_question, findings_summary, analyst_notes
    ) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)
""", (
    f"terminal_b_hungary_{timestamp}",
    "Hungary-China Belt & Road dependency analysis",
    "Found Budapest-Belgrade railway, Fudan campus, infrastructure projects",
    "CRITICAL: Hungary shows highest China dependency in EU. First BRI member. Strategic gateway for China into EU market."
))
```

---

## 🎖️ LEARNING FROM TERMINAL A

### Key Success Factors:
1. **OpenAIRE Fix Applied:** Use dict parsing, not list
2. **Warehouse-First:** Follow schema exactly
3. **China Detection:** Standardized algorithms proven at 14.2%
4. **Quality Control:** Confidence scoring essential

### Avoid These Mistakes:
1. Don't assume API structures - Terminal A found dict not list
2. Don't create new schemas - use existing warehouse
3. Don't skip provenance tracking - critical for credibility
4. Don't ignore rate limits - implement delays

---

Your Terminal B mission is strategically critical as Eastern EU represents China's primary expansion vector into Europe through the Belt & Road Initiative. Hungary is your top priority - it's the BRI gateway. Poland second for its economic size and strategic importance.

**START WITH HUNGARY** - Document every BRI project, infrastructure investment, and strategic partnership. This is where China-EU cooperation through the Belt & Road Initiative is most active.

Remember: Terminal A achieved 14.2% China collaboration rate. Focus on documenting actual findings with full source verification. Hungary's BRI participation is documented fact - verify all other claims with data.
