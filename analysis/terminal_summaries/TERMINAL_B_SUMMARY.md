## COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

### Terminal B vs Terminal A vs Terminal F

| Metric | Terminal A (Major EU) | Terminal B (Eastern EU) | Terminal F (Non-EU) |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Real Contracts | 25 collaborations | 189 TED procurements | 14 verified deals |
| Total Value | Not specified | €16.06B (incl. cancelled) | €14.02B |
| Pattern | Research focus | Mixed (real contracts + big cancelled deals) | Direct control |
| Risk Level | Technology transfer | Infrastructure/Energy | Complete dependency |

### Eastern EU Patterns
1. **Hungary** actively embracing China (€6.53B total - 46 real contracts + major investments)
2. **Poland** surprising activity (112 real contracts, though small value)
3. **Romania** retreating from exposure (€8B cancelled after 17 contracts)
4. **Others** maintaining limited, cautious engagement

## STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT

### Infrastructure Dependencies
- **Critical**: Budapest-Belgrade railway creates transport corridor
- **Energy**: Nuclear cooperation attempts in CZ, RO (mostly blocked)
- **Manufacturing**: Limited to automotive and electronics

### Technology Transfer
- **5G**: Huawei excluded in Romania, limited elsewhere
- **Research**: 10 collaborations identified, lower than Western EU
- **Education**: Fudan University represents new model of influence

### Financial Exposure
- **Active investments**: ~€5.7B (excluding cancelled projects)
- **Cancelled/Failed**: ~€9B (Cernavoda, CEFC)
- **Trend**: Increasing scrutiny leading to project cancellations

## INTELLIGENCE GAPS

1. Real-time tracking of Belt & Road project progress
2. Chinese component suppliers in automotive sector
3. Financial mechanisms used for infrastructure funding
4. Research collaboration details beyond headlines
5. Local/regional government partnerships not captured

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Monitor Hungary** - deepest integration requires continuous tracking
2. **Watch Romania** - large cancelled projects may resurface
3. **Track automotive** - Slovakia/Czechia supply chain vulnerabilities
4. **Assess infrastructure** - Poland logistics hub strategic importance
5. **Document patterns** - Eastern EU showing both embrace and rejection
