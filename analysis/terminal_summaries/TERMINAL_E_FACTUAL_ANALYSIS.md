## Analysis Without Fabrication

### What We Can Confirm:
1. Chinese organizations represent 0.34% of H2020 participants
2. Target countries have 18,575 organizations in H2020
3. Greece has highest participation (5,523 orgs), Bulgaria lowest (993 orgs)
4. COSCO controls Piraeus Port (verified)
5. China Three Gorges has EDP stake (verified)

### What We Cannot Confirm:
- Specific China collaboration rates per country (would require project-level participant analysis)
- Total funding flows to Chinese entities
- Indirect participation through subsidiaries

### Data Limitations:
- Organization data shows country registration, not project collaboration patterns
- Chinese participation may be understated if through EU subsidiaries
- Project-level participant data would be needed for accurate collaboration analysis

## Recommendations

1. **Analyze project participant data** (not just organization registry) to determine actual collaboration patterns
2. **Cross-reference Chinese organizations** with known subsidiaries and joint ventures
3. **Examine specific sectors** (maritime, energy, telecommunications) for targeted analysis
4. **Verify infrastructure ownership** through corporate registries and port authorities

## Conclusion

The CORDIS H2020 database shows:
- 598 Chinese organizations among 178,414 total (0.34%)
- Strategic gap countries have significant H2020 participation (18,575 organizations)
- Confirmed Chinese infrastructure control in Greece (Piraeus) and Portugal (EDP)
- Further analysis needed to determine actual collaboration rates and technology transfer patterns
