## INTELLIGENCE PATTERNS

### Cross-System Correlation Analysis
1. **Export Control Escalation**: Entities progress from trade to investment to export controls
2. **Technology Concentration**: Multi-system entities focus on critical technologies
3. **Risk Amplification**: Entities in multiple systems have significantly higher risk scores
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Cross-system appearance indicates sustained intelligence interest

### System-Specific Insights
- **BIS-Only Entities**: Already under export control restrictions
- **Comtrade-Only Entities**: Active in technology trade but not yet flagged
- **SEC-Only Entities**: Investment activity in US markets
- **Multi-System Entities**: Comprehensive intelligence targets requiring priority monitoring

## OPERATIONAL INTELLIGENCE VALUE

### Automated Risk Escalation Framework
- **Triple-System Entities**: Immediate priority investigation
- **Dual-System Entities**: Enhanced monitoring and analysis
- **Single-System Entities**: Baseline tracking and correlation monitoring
- **New Entity Detection**: Alert when entities appear in additional systems

### Cross-Reference Intelligence Capabilities
[SUCCESS] **Entity Normalization**: Automated name matching across systems
[SUCCESS] **Risk Correlation**: Multi-system risk score aggregation
[SUCCESS] **Technology Mapping**: Cross-system technology focus correlation
[SUCCESS] **Pattern Detection**: Multi-system appearance trend analysis

### Next Steps for Enhanced Intelligence
