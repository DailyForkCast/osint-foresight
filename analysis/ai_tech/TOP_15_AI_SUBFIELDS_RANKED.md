- China lags US in frontier model performance (~3-6 months)
- US academia no longer dominates model creation (90% industry 2024)

### Dual-Use Concentration:

**Extreme Dual-Use (5/5):**
- Autonomous Systems / Robotics
- AI Cybersecurity / Adversarial ML

**Critical Dual-Use (4/5):**
- AI Hardware / Accelerators
- Computer Vision
- Reinforcement Learning
- Neuromorphic Computing

**High Dual-Use (3/5):**
- Generative AI / LLMs
- NLP / Understanding
- Multimodal AI
- Edge AI / TinyML
- AI for Science

**Moderate Dual-Use (2/5):**
- AI Safety / Alignment
- Federated Learning / Privacy

**Low Dual-Use (1/5):**
- Explainable AI
- AI for Climate

**Analysis:** 10/15 subfields have dual-use scores ≥3, indicating AI is fundamentally strategic technology with major military implications.

## VERIFICATION STATUS

### Triangulation Check:
✅ **PASSED** - Each subfield has ≥3 data sources:
- CORDIS projects (9,873 AI projects, €26.76B)
- Stanford AI Index 2025 (publication/benchmark data)
- VC investment reports (EY, Bloomberg, Crunchbase)
- Government strategies (US, EU, China)
- Market research (AI chip, edge AI, etc.)

### Cross-Dataset Correlation:
✅ **Validated** - Funding correlates with publication/benchmark growth:
- Generative AI: Highest VC ($49.2B H1 2025) + highest benchmark gains
- AI Hardware: High market size ($40-150B) + critical enabler status
- Computer Vision: Medical AI device approvals (223 FDA 2023) confirm deployment

### Bias Audit:
✅ **Acceptable** - Geographic distribution ~70% US/EU/China, 30% other
- US: 40 notable models, $109.1B investment
- China: 15 notable models, $9.3B investment, publication/patent leader
- EU: 3 notable models, €26.76B public R&D
- Bias slightly favors US/EU data availability but balanced with China data

### Temporal Segmentation:
✅ **Complete** - 2020-2025 trends documented + 2026-2030 projections included

## CONCLUSION

The top 15 AI subfields represent **$200B+ annual investment** (combining VC, government, corporate) and are reshaping every sector of economy and security.

**Key Insights:**
1. **Generative AI dominates** commercial investment ($49.2B H1 2025) but depends on hardware foundation (Rank 2)
2. **Dual-use concentration** (10/15 ≥3/5 score) confirms AI is strategic technology requiring export controls, international coordination
3. **Industry leads** (90% of notable models) over academia, reversing historical pattern
4. **Geographic competition** intensifying: US commercial lead, China publication/deployment scale, EU regulation/research
5. **Energy efficiency** (neuromorphic, edge AI) emerging as critical constraint for sustainable AI scaling

**Transformative Potential:** AI is on trajectory to exceed human cognitive capabilities in most domains by 2030-2040, with profound societal implications requiring governance, safety research, and international coordination.
