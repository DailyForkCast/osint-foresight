**Analysis:** 10/15 subfields have dual-use scores ≥3, confirming AI is fundamentally strategic technology requiring export controls, international coordination, safety research.

### Technology Interdependencies:

**AI Hardware (Rank 2) enables ALL other subfields:**
- Computational bottleneck for frontier AI
- Export controls demonstrate strategic importance
- Declining costs (-30%/year) democratizing access
- Neuromorphic 100x efficiency could reshape landscape

**Generative AI (Rank 1) depends on:**
- AI Hardware (training infrastructure)
- Reinforcement Learning (RLHF for instruction-following)
- AI Safety / Alignment (preventing harm)
- Multimodal capabilities (vision, audio integration)

**Autonomous Systems (Rank 5) require:**
- Computer Vision (perception)

- Edge AI (on-device compute)
- AI Hardware (processing power)

**Scientific AI (Rank 9) leverages:**
- Generative AI (protein design, materials discovery)
- Multimodal AI (cross-modal scientific data)
- Specialized hardware (simulation workloads)

### Geographic Leadership Patterns:

**United States Strengths:**
- Commercial AI deployment (90% notable models from industry)
- VC funding dominance ($109.1B vs China $9.3B in 2024)
- AI hardware (Nvidia 86%, AMD, Intel, Google TPU)
- Generative AI leadership (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta)
- 40 notable AI models (2024) vs China 15, EU 3

**China Strengths:**
- Publication volume (global leader)
- Patent filings (global leader)
- Large-scale deployment (250M generative AI users by Feb 2025)
- Cost-efficient development (DeepSeek R1: $5.6M training)
- Government coordination (60% of GenAI deals have state participation)
- 302 registered generative AI models (Jan 2025)

**European Union Strengths:**
- Structured research (9,873 CORDIS projects, €26.76B)
- AI regulation/governance (AI Act global model, GDPR)
- Privacy-preserving AI (federated learning, differential privacy)
- Scientific AI (Nobel Prize 2024 protein design/AlphaFold)
- Multilingual NLP (24 official languages drive innovation)

**Key Gaps:**
- EU: Lacks major commercial AI companies (Mistral is rare exception)
- China: Lags US in frontier model performance (~3-6 months behind)
- US: Academia no longer dominates model creation (90% industry 2024 vs 60% 2023)

### Emerging Concerns:

1. **Energy Sustainability:** AI training/inference energy consumption growing exponentially. GPT-4 scale models estimated hundreds of megawatt-hours. Neuromorphic (100x efficiency) and edge AI potential solutions.

2. **Dual-Use Governance:** 10/15 high dual-use (≥3) requires export controls (chip restrictions), international coordination (UN LAWs debate, AI Safety Summit), safety research investments.

3. **Industry Dominance:** 90% of notable models from industry (2024) vs 60% (2023). Academia losing model creation role, shifting to safety/foundational research. Concentration risk: few companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta) control frontier AI.

4. **Concentration Risk:** Small number of companies control frontier AI → systemic risk, competition concerns. OpenAI Superalignment team disbanded/reconstituted shows institutional pressures may deprioritize safety.

5. **Geopolitical Competition:** US-China AI race intensifying across dimensions (research, funding, talent, standards). Export controls (US restricting H100/H800 GPUs to China). National strategies (China 1 trillion RMB, US federal AI infrastructure). EU regulatory leadership (AI Act) positions differently as standard-setter.
