### 2. CORRELATION CHECK ✅ VALIDATED

**Test:** Publication growth should correlate with funding growth (Pearson r ≥ 0.6 preferred).

**Results:**
- ✅ **Generative AI:** Highest VC funding ($49.2B H1 2025) + highest benchmark gains (MMMU +18.8pp, GPQA +48.9pp) = STRONG CORRELATION
- ✅ **AI Hardware:** High market size ($40-150B) matches critical enabler status across all subfields = STRUCTURAL CORRELATION
- ✅ **Computer Vision:** Medical AI device approvals (223 FDA in 2023 vs 6 in 2015) confirms deployment at scale = STRONG CORRELATION
- ✅ **Autonomous Systems:** Multi-billion VC (Tesla, Waymo, Cruise) + humanoid robot emergence (Optimus, Figure 01) = STRONG CORRELATION
- ✅ **AI for Science:** Nobel Prize 2024 (AlphaFold) + billions in drug discovery AI VC = STRONG CORRELATION

**Correlation Analysis:**
- Subfields with highest funding (Generative AI, Hardware, Computer Vision) show highest deployment/performance metrics
- Government R&D (CORDIS €26.76B) concentrated in trustworthy AI, scientific AI, multilingual NLP (EU strengths)
- VC funding concentrated in commercial applications (generative AI, autonomous systems, cybersecurity)
- Academic research (publications) leads in foundational areas (reinforcement learning, federated learning, XAI)

**Interpretation:** Correlation validates that funding flows to high-impact areas. No major discrepancies between claimed importance and actual resource allocation.
