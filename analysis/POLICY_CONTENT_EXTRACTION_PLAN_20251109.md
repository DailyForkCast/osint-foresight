## Text Extraction Technical Approach

### For PDFs (35 documents):
- Use PyPDF2 or pdfplumber for text extraction
- OCR fallback for scanned documents (if needed)
- Preserve document structure (headings, sections, articles)
- Extract tables and quantitative data separately
- Store both raw text and structured data

### For HTML (3 documents):
- BeautifulSoup for parsing
- Remove navigation/formatting
- Preserve content structure
- Convert to markdown for consistency

### Quality Assurance:
- Verify extraction completeness (compare file size to extracted text length)
- Check for encoding issues (Chinese characters)
- Validate table data extraction
- Manual spot-check critical documents

## Discussion Questions for You

Before proceeding with full text extraction, please confirm:

1. **Scope:** Do you want full text from all 38 documents, or should we prioritize the 15 CRITICAL documents first?

2. **Depth:** For large documents (14th FYP = 5.3 MB, SIA Report = 20 MB), do you want:
   - Full text extraction (everything)
   - Executive summaries + key sections only
   - Full text + separate key findings database

3. **Cross-references:** Which existing database tables are highest priority for linking?
   - PRC SOE entities (62 companies)
   - OpenAlex academic collaborations
   - USPTO patents
   - TED contracts
   - SEC Edgar investments
   - European policy responses

4. **Output format:** For the extracted text, do you want:
   - Plain text in database
   - Structured JSON (sections, articles, provisions)
   - Both

5. **Timeline:** Do you need this immediately, or can we do phased extraction (CRITICAL first, then HIGH, then MEDIUM)?
