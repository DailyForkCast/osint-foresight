### 3. Other COSCO Contracts (Military Sealift Command)

In addition to the DPRK contracts, COSCO entities have 9 contracts with the US Military Sealift Command (Agency Code 9700):

| Date | Amount | Description | Destination |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 2010-07-08 | $644,600 | CHARTER HIRE | South Korea |
| 2009-06-23 | $644,600 | CHARTER HIRE | China |

## Context: Six-Party Talks & Energy Assistance

### Background

The **Six-Party Talks** (2003-2009) were multilateral negotiations involving:
- North Korea (DPRK)
- South Korea (ROK)
- United States
- China
- Japan
- Russia

**Objective**: Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula

### Energy Assistance Component

**Agreement**: Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) deliveries to DPRK in exchange for nuclear facility shutdowns

**Key Events**:
- **2005**: September 19 Joint Statement (denuclearization agreement)
- **2007**: February 13 Agreement (specific HFO deliveries agreed)
  - 50,000 tons HFO for shutting down Yongbyon reactor
  - Additional 950,000 tons for complete denuclearization
- **2008**: DPRK begins disabling Yongbyon (HFO deliveries commence)
- **2009**: April - DPRK withdraws from talks, expels inspectors
- **2009**: May - Second nuclear test
- **Program officially ended**: 2009

**Implementation**:
- US coordinated HFO deliveries (funded through various mechanisms)
- Shipments sourced from multiple countries
- Delivery via contracted shipping companies

### COSCO Contracts in Context

| Contract Date | Six-Party Talks Status | Assessment |
|--------------|------------------------|------------|
| **2008-06-13** | Active (post-Feb 2007 agreement) | ✅ Aligned with program |
| **2008-11-04** | Active (Yongbyon disablement ongoing) | ✅ Aligned with program |
| **2011-06-22** | **Ended (2009)** | ⚠️ **Anomalous** |

**Critical Question**: Why does a DPRK HFO contract appear in June 2011, **2 years after** the Six-Party Talks ended?

**Possible Explanations**:
1. **Administrative Closure**: Contract modification closing out earlier shipments
2. **Humanitarian Exception**: Limited energy assistance outside Six-Party framework
3. **Data Error**: Misdated transaction or description error
4. **Covert Operation**: Sensitive diplomatic engagement (unlikely - would not appear in public records)

**Most Likely**: Administrative closure (Award ID AIDTRNC000900007_1 is modification #1 of earlier base contract from 2008-11-04)

---

## Agency Code 7200 Analysis

**Agency Code**: 7200
**Most Likely**: **USAID (US Agency for International Development)**

**Evidence**:
1. Award ID pattern: "AIDTRNC000900007" (AID = Agency for International Development)
2. "TRN" prefix (possibly "Transportation" or "Transfer")
3. USAID commonly handles foreign assistance programs
4. Six-Party Talks energy assistance would fall under USAID/State Department coordination

**Alternative Possibilities**:
- Department of State (often coordinates with USAID)
- Defense Threat Reduction Agency (handles WMD reduction programs)

**Note**: Full agency code mapping would require official USAspending.gov reference data

## Strategic Assessment

### PRC State Interests

**Why would China (PRC) facilitate US-DPRK energy assistance?**

1. **Six-Party Talks Host**: China hosted negotiations, had vested interest in success
2. **Regional Stability**: Nuclear DPRK destabilizes Northeast Asia
3. **Economic Opportunity**: COSCO contracts generate revenue
4. **Diplomatic Leverage**: Facilitator role strengthens China's regional influence
5. **DPRK Management**: China maintains influence over DPRK through economic ties

**Strategic Calculation**:
- China benefits from DPRK denuclearization (reduces US military presence justification)
- BUT also benefits from managed DPRK instability (keeps US focused on Korea, not Taiwan)
- HFO deliveries keep DPRK dependent on external energy (leverage)
- COSCO involvement ensures PRC visibility into US-DPRK engagement

### US Perspective

**Why contract with PRC SOE for DPRK deliveries?**

1. **Practical Necessity**:
   - Limited shipping options willing to engage with DPRK
   - PRC companies have existing DPRK trade relationships
   - Geographic proximity (Dalian Port → North Korea)

2. **Diplomatic Signal**:
   - PRC involvement demonstrates multilateral support for agreement
   - Reduces perception of unilateral US action
   - Shares responsibility (and potential sanctions risk)

3. **Cost-Effectiveness**:
   - Competitive pricing from PRC carriers
   - Established infrastructure for bulk cargo

**Potential Risks**:
- Intelligence access: PRC SOE has visibility into US diplomatic operations
- Sanctions vulnerability: If program becomes controversial, PRC involvement provides leverage
- Supply chain dependency: Reliance on potential adversary for sensitive mission

---

## Sanctions & Compliance Considerations

### UN Security Council Resolutions (DPRK Sanctions)

**Timeline of Escalating Sanctions**:
- **2006**: Resolution 1718 (after 1st nuclear test) - arms embargo, luxury goods
- **2009**: Resolution 1874 (after 2nd nuclear test) - expanded sanctions
- **2013+**: Multiple resolutions restricting trade, shipping, fuel

**Energy Sanctions**:
- Resolution 2397 (2017): **Banned** sale of refined petroleum products to DPRK (with exceptions)
- Resolution 2375 (2017): Limited crude oil and refined petroleum

**Critical Point**: The 2008-2011 COSCO contracts **PRE-DATE** the comprehensive fuel sanctions. Energy assistance was **legal** under the Six-Party Talks framework.

### Post-2017 COSCO Sanctions Issues

**Separate from these contracts**, COSCO entities have faced sanctions scrutiny:

- **2019**: US Treasury sanctioned COSCO Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Co. for violating Iran sanctions
- **2020**: Sanctions lifted after compliance improvements
- **Ongoing**: Enhanced due diligence for PRC shipping companies

**No evidence** these 2008-2011 contracts violated sanctions at the time.

## Intelligence Implications

### Information Access

**What did COSCO know?**
- Cargo contents: Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO)
- Destination: DPRK ports
- Timing: Coordinated with Six-Party Talks milestones
- Quantity: Potentially visible from contract terms (not in public data)
- Loading ports: US or regional sources

**What could this inform?**
- US commitment level to DPRK engagement
- Energy supply chain vulnerabilities
- Shipping routes and port capabilities
- Six-Party Talks implementation status

**Counterintelligence Concern**: PRC state-owned company had operational visibility into US diplomatic strategy toward DPRK.

### PRC Strategic Intelligence Collection

**Known PRC Intelligence Priorities**:
1. US military capabilities and deployments (Pacific)
2. US diplomatic strategies (Korea, Taiwan, regional alliances)
3. Economic leverage points (energy, trade dependencies)

**How COSCO Contracts Fit**:
- **Military charters** (9 contracts): Visibility into US Pacific logistics, deployment patterns
- **DPRK energy contracts** (3 contracts): Understanding of US diplomatic engagement strategy
- **Combined intelligence value**: Comprehensive picture of US regional operations

**Assessment**: While individual contracts may be routine commercial arrangements, the aggregate provides strategic intelligence value to PRC.

## Findings Summary

### Confirmed Facts ✅

1. **3 US government contracts** with COSCO entities for HFO transport to DPRK (2008-2011)
2. **Agency 7200** (likely USAID) administered contracts
3. **Legal at time of execution** (part of Six-Party Talks energy assistance)
4. **9 additional contracts** with Military Sealift Command (2003-2010, $2.27M)
5. **COSCO is PRC state-owned** enterprise (strategic infrastructure sector)
6. **Post-2016 merger** created world's 4th largest shipping company

### Key Uncertainties ❓

1. **2011 contract purpose** (2 years after Six-Party Talks ended)
   - Most likely: Administrative closure
   - Possible: Limited humanitarian shipment
   - Unlikely: Continuation of full program

2. **Total HFO quantity delivered** (not in public contract data)
   - Reference: "72 1000" in one description (72,000 tons? 1,000 tons?)
   - Six-Party Talks target: 50,000-1,000,000 tons total (all deliveries, all countries)

3. **Other carriers involved** (COSCO may not be exclusive provider)
   - These records only show USAspending.gov data
   - Other countries may have contracted separate deliveries

### Strategic Concerns ⚠️

1. **PRC SOE intelligence access** to US diplomatic/military operations
2. **Continued relationship** with COSCO post-merger (2016 onward)
3. **Dual-use logistics** (commercial + politically sensitive missions)
4. **Supply chain dependency** on potential strategic competitor

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Verify 2011 Contract Status**
   - Request official records from USAID/State Department
   - Confirm whether shipment occurred or was administrative closure
   - Determine compliance with post-2009 DPRK policy

2. **Map Complete COSCO Relationship**
   - Extract all COSCO contracts across all agencies (not just these 12)
   - Timeline: 2000-2025
   - Include post-merger COSCO Shipping Corporation contracts
   - Identify current active contracts

3. **Agency Code Validation**
   - Confirm agency code 7200 identity
   - Cross-reference with USAspending.gov agency master list
   - Determine if other DPRK-related contracts exist under 7200

### Short-Term Analysis

1. **PRC SOE Merger Impact Study**
   - Document all major PRC SOE mergers (2010-2020)
   - Map to US contract portfolio
   - Identify concentration risks (multiple legacy companies → single entity)

2. **Military Sealift Command Alternatives**
   - Identify non-PRC shipping options for Pacific logistics
   - Cost-benefit analysis: Price premium vs. reduced intelligence risk
   - Policy recommendation: Diversification requirements

3. **Intelligence Assessment**
   - Request classified briefing on PRC shipping company intelligence activities
   - Determine if COSCO specifically identified as collection vector
   - Review counterintelligence mitigation strategies

### Long-Term Strategic Considerations

1. **Supply Chain Security**
   - Develop maritime logistics resilience plan
   - Reduce dependency on potential adversary-controlled shipping
   - Invest in US/allied shipping capacity

2. **Sanctions Coordination**
   - Lessons learned: Using sanctioned country's neighbor for deliveries
   - Future consideration: Avoid PRC intermediaries for sensitive programs
   - Alternative: US/allied logistics for diplomatic missions

3. **Policy Framework**
   - Should PRC SOEs be eligible for politically sensitive contracts?
   - Tier 1 entities: Enhanced vetting for national security contracts
   - Develop "trusted carrier" program for sensitive maritime logistics
