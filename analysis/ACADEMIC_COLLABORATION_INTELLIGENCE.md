## Integration with Bilateral Relations Framework

### Disconnects Identified

**Lithuania Paradox:**
- **Diplomatic**: Taiwan office, China trade war, EU WTO champion
- **Academic**: 1,660 collaborative works, ongoing research ties
- **Implication**: Political confrontation doesn't immediately sever research

**Czech Republic Paradox:**
- **Diplomatic**: Taiwan visit, cyber accusations
- **Academic**: #3 in EU (269K works), Czech Academy heavily engaged
- **Implication**: 2020 Taiwan visit didn't stop research (or research paused later?)

**Poland Paradox:**
- **Diplomatic**: Security-first, Huawei 5G ban, Ukraine impact
- **Academic**: #4 in EU (205K works), Polish Academy dominant
- **Implication**: NATO frontline status coexists with massive academic ties

**UK Paradox:**
- **Diplomatic**: Golden era → Huawei ban → spy scandal
- **Academic**: #1 in EU (365K works), Newcastle alone = 127K works
- **Implication**: Technology restrictions don't affect basic research (yet?)

**Germany Puzzle:**
- **Diplomatic**: Major economy, €6.5B acquisitions, FDI screening leader
- **Academic**: Only #11 (11,791 works), surprisingly low engagement
- **Possible Explanation**: German data may be underrepresented OR German institutions more cautious

## Timeline Analysis Needed

### Questions for Temporal Investigation:

1. **When did these collaborations peak?**
   - Pre-2016 (before tech restrictions)?
   - 2017-2019 (BRI/golden era)?
   - Post-2020 (despite decoupling rhetoric)?

2. **Have collaborations declined after diplomatic incidents?**
   - Lithuania post-Taiwan office (2021)
   - Czech Republic post-Senate visit (2020)
   - UK post-Huawei ban (2020)

3. **Which technology domains show declining collaboration?**
   - Semiconductors after export controls?
   - AI after cyber accusations?
   - Quantum after security warnings?

4. **Which institutions closed or restricted China partnerships?**
   - Confucius Institute closures
   - University partnership terminations
   - Joint lab dissolutions

**Data Available:** OpenAlex works have publication_year field - temporal analysis possible!

## Missing Data Layers

### Not Yet Integrated:

**1. Sister City Relationships**
- **Tables exist** (cultural_institutions, academic_partnerships) but **empty**
- Critical for understanding subnational ties
- Example: Hamburg-Shanghai sister city (referenced in bilateral events)

**2. Joint Funding Programs**
- Horizon Europe projects with Chinese partners
- National bilateral research funds (e.g., DFG-NSFC Germany-China)
- Industry-academia collaboration (Huawei university partnerships)

**3. University Partnership Agreements**
- Student exchange programs (Erasmus+ extensions to China)
- Joint degree programs (dual PhDs, joint masters)
- Faculty exchange agreements
- Joint research centers

**4. Confucius Institutes**
- **Critical intelligence gap**
- Closures in Sweden, Belgium, Czech Republic, others
- Tie to diplomatic tensions timeline
- "Soft power" vs. "influence operations" debate

**5. Chinese Students in Europe**
- Total counts by country
- STEM vs. social sciences distribution
- Scholarship programs (CSC - China Scholarship Council)
- Return rates and technology transfer concerns

**6. European Students/Faculty in China**
- Reverse flow measurements
- Joint research stays
- Brain drain concerns

## Data Quality Issues

### OpenAlex Coverage Concerns:

**Underrepresented Countries:**
- Germany (11,791 works) seems too low for major economy
- France (19,815 works) also surprisingly low
- Netherlands (1,517 works) despite strong research sector

**Possible Explanations:**
1. OpenAlex indexing bias toward English-language publications
2. National research databases not fully integrated
3. Recent works (2020-2024) still being indexed
4. Some countries publish more in national journals

**Data Completeness:**
- H-Index: NULL for all institutions (not populated)
- Technology domain: Only 17,739 of 1.56M works classified (1.1%)
- Country codes: May miss some affiliations

**Recommendation:** Cross-validate with:
- Scopus/Web of Science for comprehensive coverage
- National research databases (German DFG, French CNRS, etc.)
- EU Horizon 2020/Horizon Europe project databases

## Policy Implications

### Current State Analysis:

**Diplomatic Decoupling ≠ Academic Decoupling (Yet)**
- 1.56M collaborative works suggest deep integration
- Technology restrictions (5G, semiconductors) don't immediately affect research
- Political tensions (Lithuania, Czech Republic) coexist with ongoing collaboration

**Eastern Europe China Paradox:**
- Most China-skeptical countries diplomatically (LT, CZ, PL)
- Among highest academic collaboration levels (CZ #3, PL #4)
- National academies deeply embedded with Chinese counterparts

**UK "Golden Era" Legacy:**
- #1 in EU collaboration despite policy reversal
- Newcastle alone (127K works) > entire German system
- Suggests research momentum takes years to shift

**Technology Domain Risk:**
- 28% in dual-use domains (AI, semiconductors, quantum)
- Advanced materials and energy = strategic dependencies
- Neuroscience and space = potential military applications

### Three Scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Continued Quiet Collaboration**
- Research ties persist despite diplomatic tensions
- Universities resist politicization of science
- Collaborations slowly decline but remain substantial
- **Likelihood:** Moderate (current trend)

**Scenario 2: Accelerated Decoupling**
- Technology restrictions expand to basic research
- Funding programs terminate China partnerships
- Confucius Institutes close en masse
- Student flows restricted
- **Likelihood:** Increasing (US model spreading to EU)

**Scenario 3: Selective Restriction**
- Dual-use domains (AI, quantum, semiconductors) restricted
- Basic science (neuroscience, materials, energy) continues
- European "strategic autonomy" approach
- Differentiated by country (Germany ≠ Lithuania)
- **Likelihood:** Most probable (EU pragmatism)
