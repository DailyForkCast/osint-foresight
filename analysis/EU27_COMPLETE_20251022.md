## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Exceptionally Well
1. **Batch processing approach** - Strategic groupings accelerated expansion
2. **Helper function efficiency** - cite(), link(), event() pattern was fast
3. **Multi-source from start** - Building with 2-3 sources prevented retroactive work
4. **Strategic event selection** - Focus on geopolitically significant events maximized intelligence value
5. **Automated verification** - verify_all_countries.py caught issues immediately

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Schema consistency** - Different tables have different field names (resolved with PRAGMA checks)
2. **UK/GB naming** - Event IDs use UK_ but country_code is GB (special case handling)
3. **Citation quality balance** - Mixing official government + major news + expert analysis
4. **Event significance assessment** - Balancing comprehensiveness with strategic relevance

### Best Practices Established
1. **Always start with 2-3 sources per record** (easier than enhancement)
2. **Check table schema with PRAGMA** before bulk inserts
3. **Focus on geopolitically significant events** over routine diplomacy
4. **Mix source types:** government + news + expert for triangulation
5. **Document strategic significance explicitly** in every record
6. **Commit and verify after each batch** (catch errors early)
