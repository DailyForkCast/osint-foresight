| Commercial Launch Overall | $11.9B | $20B+ | 15.1% |
| Active Debris Removal | <$100M | Few $100M | High |

### Critical Success Factors (All Subfields):

1. **Cost Reduction:** Reusable launch achieving $10-50/kg
2. **Technology Maturation:** Propellant transfer, nuclear propulsion, ISRU
3. **Regulatory Clarity:** Debris removal liability, spectrum allocation, export controls
4. **Sustainable Economics:** Mega-constellations profitable, servicing viable
5. **International Cooperation:** Artemis Accords, space traffic management, debris standards

### Critical Risks (All Subfields):

1. **Kessler Syndrome:** Collision cascades making LEO unusable
2. **Budget Volatility:** NASA -24% FY2026 proposal threatens Artemis
3. **Technology Gaps:** Starship delays, heat shields, propellant transfer
4. **Geopolitical Tensions:** China-US space race, export controls
5. **Single Points of Failure:** SpaceX dominance, Bluefors cryogenics monopoly
