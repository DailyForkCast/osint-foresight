# EXECUTIVE BRIEF: Slovakia Research Security Crisis
**Immediate Action Required by October 31, 2025**

## THE SITUATION (September 11, 2025)

Slovakia faces an active research security crisis with 3-4 months remaining to prevent irreversible technology capture. The €1.2 billion Gotion-InoBat battery joint venture, now producing military drone batteries, represents the most critical single threat.

**Key Numbers:**
- **113** Chinese partnerships identified
- **76** EU-funded projects with Chinese participation  
- **70** co-invented patents with Chinese entities
- **25** partnerships with PLA-affiliated universities
- **4** confirmed PLA "Seven Sons" universities engaged
- **€1.2B** at risk in Gotion battery JV
- **0/10** security framework score

## CRITICAL THREATS

### 1. Gotion-InoBat Battery JV (IMMEDIATE)
- **Status**: 15 months into development, supply chains locking NOW
- **Risk**: Military E10 drone battery in production since May 2025
- **Exposure**: €1.2B investment, 20 GWh capacity, state aid approved
- **Window**: October 2025 is LAST CHANCE for intervention

### 2. PLA University Penetration (ACTIVE)
- Northwestern Polytechnical University (joint research center)
- Beijing Institute of Technology (CORDIS projects)
- Beihang University (aerospace collaboration)
- Harbin Institute of Technology (confirmed presence)

### 3. Technology Hemorrhage (ONGOING)
- Photoneo (3D vision) → Zebra Technologies (US)
- SPINEA (precision reducers) → Timken (US)  
- 70 patents co-invented with Chinese entities
- Critical sectors: AI/robotics, quantum optics, batteries

## EMERGENCY ACTIONS (By October 31, 2025)

### Week 1-2 (By September 25)
1. **Brief senior leadership** on crisis severity
2. **Convene emergency task force** (Economy, Defense, Foreign Affairs, NBU)
3. **Freeze NEW partnerships** with PLA universities immediately

### Week 3-4 (By October 10)
1. **Stand up JV Oversight Board** for Gotion-InoBat
2. **Classify E10 military battery** for export control
3. **Audit quantum research** collaborations at UPJŠ Košice

### Week 5-6 (By October 31)
1. **Implement screening mechanism** for new partnerships
2. **Review all Horizon Europe** projects with Chinese participation
3. **Issue emergency guidance** on research security

## SUCCESS METRICS (Realistic for September 2025)

### Minimum Success (25-30% probability)
- JV Oversight Board operational
- Export controls on military batteries
- No new PLA partnerships after October 1
- Penetration held below 60%

### What We CANNOT Achieve
- Reversing the €1.2B Gotion investment
- Recovering compromised technology
- Stopping signed partnerships
- Full research security by 2025

## STAKEHOLDER MESSAGING

### Government
"Investment welcome, but supply chain transparency and security controls are non-negotiable for critical technologies."

### Industry  
"Compliance with security measures protects your IP and ensures continued EU funding access."

### Academia
"Open collaboration continues, but with clear rules: publish MoUs, protect IP, screen partners."

## DECISION POINTS

### October 15, 2025
- Go/No-Go on JV intervention
- Decision on PLA partnership freeze
- Budget allocation for security measures

### November 1, 2025
- Review intervention effectiveness
- Adjust 2026 security framework plans
- Engage EU/NATO if needed

### December 1, 2025
- Final 2025 assessment
- Lock 2026 implementation plan
- Measure penetration rate

## RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS

### Immediate (October)
- €500K for security review team
- 5 FTE for JV Oversight Board
- Legal authority for partnership freeze

### Near-term (November-December)
- €2M for security framework development
- 10 FTE for implementation team
- IT systems for screening/monitoring

## RISK OF INACTION

If no action by October 31, 2025:
- Gotion supply chains become irreversible
- Penetration exceeds 60% threshold
- EU funding compromised for 2026
- NATO trust degraded
- Technology sovereignty lost

## BOTTOM LINE

Slovakia has a 3-4 month window to prevent complete research security failure. The Gotion-InoBat military battery JV and PLA university partnerships require immediate intervention. Success now means damage limitation, not prevention. Without action by October 31, 2025, Slovakia risks becoming a cautionary tale for EU/NATO research security.

**RECOMMENDATION**: Implement emergency protocol focusing on JV oversight, export controls, and partnership freeze. Accept that this is damage control, not prevention.
