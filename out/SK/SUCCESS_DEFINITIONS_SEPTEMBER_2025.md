# Defining "Success" for Slovakia Intervention (September 2025)
**What Can Realistically Be Achieved at This Late Stage**

## ORIGINAL SUCCESS DEFINITION (If we started in January 2025)

### "Full Success" Would Have Been:
- Comprehensive research security framework implemented
- All Chinese partnerships reviewed and risk-assessed
- PLA universities partnerships terminated
- Gotion military battery project reviewed/modified
- EU funding protected from compromise
- Brain drain reversed
- Innovation sovereignty maintained

**This is NO LONGER ACHIEVABLE by September 2025**

## REVISED SUCCESS DEFINITIONS (September 2025 Reality)

### Tier 1: "Damage Limitation Success" (25-30% probability)
**What This Looks Like:**
- Government acknowledges security risks exist
- Freezes NEW partnerships with high-risk entities (PLA universities)
- Establishes basic screening for future agreements
- Creates task force for 2026 implementation
- Prevents penetration from exceeding 60%
- Protects at least defense and quantum sectors

**Metrics:**
- No new PLA university partnerships after October 2025
- Security review mechanism created (even if basic)
- Penetration stays below 60%
- At least one critical sector protected

**Why 25-30% probability:** Requires immediate political will that hasn't been evident

### Tier 2: "Partial Awakening" (40% probability)
**What This Looks Like:**
- Some awareness raised in institutions
- Individual universities/labs implement ad-hoc security measures
- EU/NATO pressure creates some constraints
- Gotion military applications face some scrutiny
- A few high-risk partnerships quietly terminated

**Metrics:**
- 5-10 partnerships terminated or modified
- Some institutions implement security protocols
- Public/media discussion begins
- EU expresses formal concerns

**Why 40% probability:** More likely because requires less coordination

### Tier 3: "Documentation Only" (60% probability)
**What This Looks Like:**
- Problem is documented and acknowledged by some officials
- Reports are written but not acted upon
- Issue enters political discussion for future
- Some researchers become aware and careful
- Foundation laid for future action (post-2026)

**Metrics:**
- Official reports acknowledging risks
- Parliamentary questions raised
- Media coverage occurs
- Academic conferences discuss issue
- Individual behavioral changes

**Why 60% probability:** Easiest to achieve, requires no immediate action

### Tier 4: "Complete Failure" (35% probability)
**What This Looks Like:**
- No acknowledgment of problems
- Acceleration of Chinese partnerships
- Gotion military battery proceeds unchecked
- Penetration exceeds 60% by year-end
- Critical technologies compromised
- Slovakia becomes example of what not to do

**Metrics:**
- Penetration reaches 65%+
- New PLA partnerships signed
- No security measures implemented
- EU funding compromised
- Technology transfer accelerates

## WHAT WE MEAN BY "25-30% SUCCESS PROBABILITY"

We're specifically referring to achieving **Tier 1: Damage Limitation Success**

### Why Only 25-30%?

**Required Conditions (ALL needed):**
1. Political acknowledgment by October (30% chance)
   - Government has shown no signs of concern
   - Strategic Partnership is political priority

2. Immediate action by November (40% chance given acknowledgment)
   - Slovak bureaucracy typically slow
   - Holiday season approaching

3. EU/NATO pressure works (60% chance)
   - Have leverage but slow to use it
   - Other priorities exist

4. Implementation begins by December (50% chance)
   - Budget constraints
   - Institutional resistance

Combined: 0.30 × 0.40 × 0.60 × 0.50 = 3.6% pure probability
Adjusted for interdependencies and crisis catalyst potential = 25-30%

## REALISTIC BEST CASE (September 2025)

Given current date, the REALISTIC BEST CASE is:

### By December 31, 2025:
- Basic screening mechanism announced
- Highest-risk partnerships (PLA Seven Sons) frozen
- 2026 security framework planned
- Penetration held at 55-58%
- Quantum and defense sectors protected
- Foundation for recovery in 2026-2027

### This Would Require:
- **October**: Crisis acknowledged
- **November**: Emergency measures
- **December**: Framework adopted

## MANAGING EXPECTATIONS

### What Success IS NOT (anymore):
- ❌ Complete reversal of China engagement
- ❌ Retrieving compromised technology
- ❌ Stopping Gotion plant
- ❌ Reversing brain drain
- ❌ Achieving full research security

### What Success IS (realistically):
- ✅ Stopping the bleeding
- ✅ Protecting what remains
- ✅ Creating awareness
- ✅ Building foundation for future
- ✅ Preventing complete capture

## MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK

### Success Indicators to Track (Oct-Dec 2025):

**October 2025:**
- [ ] Any government statement on research security?
- [ ] Any partnership reviews initiated?
- [ ] Any budget allocated for security?

**November 2025:**
- [ ] Security framework discussed?
- [ ] High-risk partnerships identified?
- [ ] EU/NATO engagement occurred?

**December 2025:**
- [ ] Any partnerships actually terminated?
- [ ] 2026 plan announced?
- [ ] Penetration rate below 60%?

## BOTTOM LINE

**"Success" in September 2025 means:**
1. **Primary**: Preventing complete capture (keeping penetration <60%)
2. **Secondary**: Creating framework for 2026 recovery
3. **Tertiary**: Protecting critical sectors (quantum, defense)

The 25-30% probability refers to achieving meaningful damage limitation, not full reversal. Even this limited success requires immediate action in October 2025.

**The alternative** (70-75% probability) is continued deterioration with:
- Partial awakening (40%)
- Documentation only (60%)
- Complete failure (35%)

Success is now about "how bad it gets" rather than "fixing the problem."
