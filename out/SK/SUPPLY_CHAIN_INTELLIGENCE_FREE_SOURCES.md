    # 703 = Slovakia, 156 = China
    url = "https://comtrade.un.org/api/get"
    params = {
        'r': reporter,  # Slovakia
        'p': partner,   # China
        'ps': year,
        'px': 'HS',
        'cc': '8507',   # HS code for batteries
        'fmt': 'json'
    }
    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
    return pd.DataFrame(response.json()['dataset'])

# Analyze battery component imports
battery_components = {
    '8507': 'Electric batteries',
    '2836': 'Carbonates (lithium)',
    '8506': 'Primary cells',
    '3801': 'Graphite',
    '2805': 'Rare earth metals'
}

for hs_code, description in battery_components.items():

- Detailed bills of lading
- Private company suppliers
- Tier 2/3 suppliers
- Pricing information
- Contract terms

### 11.2 Workarounds

**For Real-Time Tracking:**
- Combine multiple port websites
- Use vessel tracking for inference
- Monitor social media for disruptions

**For Private Companies:**
- Job postings often reveal suppliers
- Local news coverage
- Industry event attendee lists
- Patent collaborations

**For Deep Tier Visibility:**
- Sustainability reports sometimes include

## 12. KEY INSIGHTS FOR SLOVAKIA ANALYSIS

### 12.1 Specific Free Sources for Gotion-InoBat

1. **Slovak Statistical Office** (statistics.sk)
   - Monthly trade with China
   - HS 8507 battery imports
   - Chemical imports (lithium, cobalt)

2. **Port of Koper** (luka-kp.si)
   - Main sea route for Slovakia
   - Vessel arrivals with cargo types
   - Container traffic statistics

3. **German Federal Statistics** (destatis.de)
   - Transit trade through Germany
   - Battery component flows

4. **Gotion Sustainability Reports**
   - Should list key suppliers
   - Environmental impact data
   - Supply chain policies

5. **Patent Analysis** (Lens.org)
   - Gotion-supplier co-patents
   - Technology dependencies
   - Licensed technologies

### 12.2 Red Flags to Monitor

**Supply Chain Concentration:**
- >50% single source for any component
- All logistics through one route
- Single technology dependency

**Financial Stress Indicators:**
- Trade credit insurance downgrades
- Commodity price spikes
- Payment delays in trade data

**Operational Indicators:**
- Satellite: Reduced activity at supplier
- Shipping: Route changes
- Personnel: Mass departures on LinkedIn

## BOTTOM LINE

**With free and low-cost sources, we can map 60-70% of Tier 1 supply chain and identify major dependencies**. The key is systematic collection and creative integration of multiple data sources. While we can't match the detail of paid services like Panjiva ($10,000+/year), we can identify critical vulnerabilities and concentration risks.

**Most Valuable Free Sources for Supply Chain:**
1. UN Comtrade (trade flows)
2. Port websites (shipping patterns)
3. Sustainability reports (supplier disclosure)
4. Patent databases (technology dependencies)
5. LinkedIn (personnel connections)

**Time Investment:** 10-15 hours initial setup, 2-3 hours weekly monitoring

---
**Key Finding**: Supply chain intelligence is possible without expensive subscriptions, but requires more manual effort and creative data integration.
