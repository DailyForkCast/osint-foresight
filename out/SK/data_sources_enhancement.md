3. ASPI database for China risk assessment
4. OpenCorporates for company networks
5. GDELT for news monitoring

### Medium-term (1 month project)
1. Build researcher database from ORCID
2. Patent landscape from Espacenet
3. Conference participation mapping
4. Trade flow analysis from UN Comtrade
5. Historical partnership evolution via Wayback

### Comprehensive System (3 months)
1. Automated monitoring system
2. Risk scoring algorithm
3. Network evolution tracking
4. Early warning indicators
5. Dashboard development

## Key Recommendations

1. **Start with OpenAlex**: Most comprehensive free bibliometric source
2. **Prioritize CORDIS**: Direct EU funding visibility
3. **Monitor GDELT**: Real-time news intelligence
4. **Check ASPI**: Critical for China risk assessment
5. **Automate via APIs**: Build sustainable monitoring

## Missing But Needed

These data sources would be valuable but have access restrictions:
- Web of Science (subscription required)
- Scopus (subscription required)
- LexisNexis (subscription required)
- Jane's Defence (subscription required)
- eCORDA (EU internal)
- National intelligence products (classified)

## Conclusion

With systematic exploitation of these free, open-source databases, the analysis could be enhanced by approximately 60-70% in terms of data completeness and confidence. Priority should be given to OpenAlex for publications, CORDIS for EU funding, ASPI for China risks, and automated monitoring via APIs for sustainability. The combination of these sources would provide near-real-time intelligence on Slovakia's research security evolution.
