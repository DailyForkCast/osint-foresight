   - Research security legislation
   - Supplier transparency rules
   - Export control updates
   - Cost: €5-8M
   - Success probability: 40-60%

2. **Prepare Implementation**
   - Institutional capacity building
   - Monitoring system design
   - Compliance mechanisms
   - Cost: €8-12M

### 7.3 Adaptive Management

- Review points: Every 3 months
- Adjustment triggers: Defined metrics
- Exit strategies: For each intervention
- Learning incorporation: Systematic

## 8. CONCLUSION WITHOUT ALARMISM

Slovakia faces technology governance challenges common to many EU member states. The Gotion-InoBat investment represents both opportunity (jobs, technology, development) and risk (dependencies, dual-use, sovereignty).

Current evidence suggests:
- Risk levels: Elevated but not exceptional (compared to regional peers)
- Intervention window: 12-24 months for meaningful measures
- Success probability: 35-65% depending on scope
- Cost-benefit: Positive for targeted interventions

The optimal approach involves gradual implementation of oversight mechanisms while maintaining investment attractiveness. Extreme measures carry higher costs than benefits based on current evidence.
