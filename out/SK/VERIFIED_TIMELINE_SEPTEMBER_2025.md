## CORRECTIONS to Our Assessment

### 1. EU Mid-term Review
- **Our assumption**: "Likely completed" by September 2025
- **Reality**: Completed February 29, 2024 - much earlier
- **Impact**: Slovakia has had more time to adjust to new funding priorities

### 2. Construction Timeline
- **Our assumption**: Gotion-InoBat construction "starting"
- **Reality**: Construction began August 2024, now 13+ months underway
- **Impact**: Project is further along than we estimated - MORE URGENT

### 3. MSM Contract Value
- **Our reference**: General expansion
- **Reality**: Specific $635 million U.S. Army contract
- **Impact**: Larger and more strategic than initially assessed

### 4. InoBat E10 Production
- **Our assumption**: "Production underway"
- **Reality**: Production starts September 2025 (this month!)
- **Impact**: Critical decision point is NOW

## UPDATED Risk Assessment

Given the verified timeline:

1. **Gotion-InoBat is FURTHER ALONG** than we thought
   - Construction 13+ months in progress
   - Supply chains likely already locked
   - Intervention window even smaller

2. **InoBat E10 production starts THIS MONTH**
   - September 2025 production launch imminent
   - Export control implementation URGENT
   - NATO compliance claims need verification

3. **Strategic Partnership is NEWER** than implied
   - Signed November 2024 (10 months ago)
   - Still in honeymoon phase
   - Political will for reversal unlikely

## Implications for Action

### IMMEDIATE (By September 30, 2025)
- E10 production starting THIS MONTH requires immediate export control decision
- Cannot wait until October for intervention

### CRITICAL (By October 15, 2025)
- Gotion-InoBat already 13+ months into construction
- Supply chain interventions may already be too late
- Focus must shift to oversight and control mechanisms

### REALISTIC (By December 31, 2025)
- Accept that prevention is impossible
- Focus entirely on damage limitation
- Prepare 2026 recovery framework

## Bottom Line

The verified timeline shows the situation is MORE URGENT than our assessment indicated:
- Construction is further along (13+ months)
- Military battery production starts THIS MONTH
- Strategic partnership is politically fresh (10 months)
- EU funding revision completed earlier (giving more time for exploitation)

**Updated Success Probability: 20-25%** (reduced from 25-30% due to timeline realities)
