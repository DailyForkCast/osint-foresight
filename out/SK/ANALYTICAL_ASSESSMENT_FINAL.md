## 10. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

Slovakia's engagement with Chinese investment in the battery sector represents a significant economic opportunity with associated dependencies and uncertainties. The €1.2 billion Gotion-InoBat joint venture will likely proceed as planned, creating employment and manufacturing capacity. Technology transfer appears bidirectional with Slovakia gaining manufacturing capabilities while providing market access and potential dual-use applications.

Current oversight mechanisms are limited but not absent. Enhancement would require 18-24 months and €25-40 million investment. The probability of significant security issues appears moderate (30-40%) while economic benefits appear likely (70-80%) though potentially below projections.

Comparative regional analysis suggests Slovakia's exposure is higher than some peers but not unprecedented. The absence of a comprehensive research security framework is notable but not unique in the region.
