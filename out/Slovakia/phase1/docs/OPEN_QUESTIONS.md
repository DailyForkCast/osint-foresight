# Open Questions - Phase 1 OSINT Slovakia
**Generated: 2025-01-10**

## Critical Data Gaps Requiring Manual Follow-up

### 1. Institution-Level Budget Allocations
**Gap**: Cannot breakdown total R&D budgets to specific institutions
**Required Actions**:
- Contact Ministry of Finance SR for detailed budget execution data
- Request APVV for institution-level grant distribution statistics
- Obtain VEGA/KEGA award lists by institution for 2018-2025
- Access ROR database to properly code all Slovak institutions

**Specific Questions**:
- How is the €60M SAS budget distributed among 56 institutes?
- What is the breakdown of €551M Recovery Plan R&D funds by institution?
- Which universities receive the most VEGA/KEGA funding?

### 2. Chinese Funding Amounts
**Gap**: Partnership identified but financial values missing
**Required Actions**:
- File FOIA-equivalent requests with Slovak universities
- Search Chinese-language sources (NSFC, MoST databases)
- Contact university research offices directly
- Review MoU texts if publicly available

**Specific Questions**:
- What is the total value of Huawei contracts with Slovak universities?
- How much funding flows through the 3 Confucius Institutes?
- What is the budget of the SAS-Northwestern Polytechnical joint center?
- Which of the 25 PLA-linked partnerships involve financial transfers?

### 3. Actual Dual-Use Projects
**Gap**: Only eligibility confirmed, no specific Slovak projects identified
**Required Actions**:
- Query EU Funding & Tenders portal with Slovak filter
- Contact Slovak Ministry of Defense for EDF participation list
- Search NATO SPS project database for Slovak participants
- Review CORDIS security topic calls for Slovak beneficiaries

**Specific Questions**:
- Which Slovak entities have won EDF grants 2021-2025?
- What NATO SPS projects include Slovak participants?
- Are there Horizon Europe security projects with Slovak involvement?
- Which dual-use technologies are being developed in Slovakia?

### 4. Recent Technology Transfer Metrics
**Gap**: No data post-2016 for patents, no systematic TT tracking
**Required Actions**:
- Contact CVTI SR directly for NPTT statistics 2018-2025
- Request SAS KTT annual reports
- Query WIPO Global Brand Database for Slovak applicants
- Access EPO PATSTAT for detailed Slovak patent data

**Specific Questions**:
- How many patents filed by Slovak institutions 2018-2025?
- Number of licenses granted annually?
- Count of spin-offs from universities and SAS?
- Revenue from technology transfer activities?

### 5. Foreign Researcher Detailed Counts
**Gap**: Only percentages available, need absolute numbers by nationality
**Required Actions**:
- Purchase Eurostat rd_p_perscitz dataset access
- Contact Statistical Office of Slovak Republic
- Request data from Ministry of Education
- Survey major universities for foreign staff statistics

**Specific Questions**:
- Exact number of foreign researchers by country of origin?
- How many Chinese researchers in Slovak institutions?
- Breakdown by sector (GOV/HE/BES/PNP)?
- Trends 2018-2025 in foreign researcher numbers?

### 6. BERD by Specific Industry
**Gap**: Only sectoral percentages, need amounts by NACE2 code
**Required Actions**:
- Access Eurostat rd_e_berdindr2 dataset directly
- Query OECD ANBERD database for Slovakia
- Contact Statistical Office SR for detailed surveys
- Review annual reports of major R&D companies

**Specific Questions**:
- R&D spending in automotive sector specifically?
- ICT sector BERD breakdown?
- Pharmaceutical/biotech R&D investments?
- Year-on-year trends by industry 2018-2025?

## Technical Access Requirements

### Databases Needing Direct Access:
1. **Eurostat**: rd_p_perscitz, rd_e_berdindr2, GBARD detailed
2. **OECD**: ANBERD, MSTI, BERD_INDUSTRY_ISIC4
3. **CORDIS**: API access for Slovak project extraction
4. **WIPO**: PATSTAT, Global Brand Database
5. **OpenAlex/Crossref**: API for funding acknowledgments

### Authorities to Contact:
1. Statistical Office of Slovak Republic
2. Ministry of Finance SR - Budget Department
3. Ministry of Education - Higher Education Section
4. CVTI SR - Technology Transfer Centre
5. Industrial Property Office SR

## Analytical Questions for Phase 2S

Based on gaps identified:
1. How dependent is Slovak R&D on EU vs national vs foreign funding?
2. What is the real scale of Chinese research influence beyond partnerships?
3. Which critical technologies lack domestic funding?
4. How does Slovak TT performance compare to V4 peers?
5. What are the supply chain vulnerabilities in R&D inputs?

## Priority Ranking for Resolution

**HIGH PRIORITY** (affects risk assessment):
- Chinese funding amounts and mechanisms
- Actual dual-use project participation
- Foreign researcher detailed origins

**MEDIUM PRIORITY** (affects capability assessment):
- Institution-level budget allocations
- BERD by specific industry
- Recent patent/TT metrics

**LOW PRIORITY** (nice to have):
- Historical trend completeness
- Minor institution coding
- Regional breakdowns

## Estimated Effort to Resolve

- **1-2 days**: Database access and extraction (if credentials available)
- **3-5 days**: Authority contacts and responses
- **1 week**: Chinese source translation and analysis
- **2 weeks**: Complete resolution of all gaps with follow-ups

## Risk of Non-Resolution

**If these gaps remain**:
- Cannot assess institution-level concentration risk
- China influence measurement remains qualitative
- Dual-use exposure stays theoretical
- Technology transfer efficiency unknown
- Foreign influence networks unmapped
- Industry R&D priorities unclear

**Recommendation**: Prioritize HIGH PRIORITY items for immediate follow-up before Phase 2S analysis.
