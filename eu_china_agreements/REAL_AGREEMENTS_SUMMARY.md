# Summary of Real EU-China Agreements (Verified from Official Sources)

## Executive Summary
Using proper methodology and official sources, we have identified and verified **26 actual agreements and partnerships** between the EU/European countries and China.

## Comparison: Fantasy vs Reality

| Category | Common Crawl Claims | Actually Verified |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Total Agreements | 4,579 | **26** |
| Sister Cities | 812 | **17** (15 active, 2 terminated) |
| BRI MOUs | 92 | **5** (4 active, 1 withdrawn) |
| EU-Level Agreements | Unknown | **4** (3 active, 1 frozen) |

## What We Actually Found

### 1. EU-Level Agreements (4 total)
- **Trade and Cooperation Agreement (1985)** - Active, renewed annually since 1990
- **Maritime Transport Agreement (2002)** - Active
- **Customs Cooperation Agreement (2004)** - Active
- **Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (2020)** - FROZEN since May 2021 due to sanctions dispute

### 2. Belt and Road Initiative MOUs (5 verified)
- **Hungary (2015)** - Active, first European country to join
- **Poland (2015)** - Active, Chengdu-Lodz railway corridor

- **Portugal (2018)** - Active, energy and Port of Sines investments
- **Italy (2019)** - WITHDRAWN December 2023, only G7 member to join

Note: Reports claim 18 EU members have BRI MOUs, but we could only verify 5 with specific dates and details.

### 3. Sister City Partnerships (17 verified)

#### Active Partnerships (15)
Beijing has partnerships with:
- Berlin, Paris, Rome, Madrid, Brussels, Amsterdam, Athens
- Budapest, Bucharest, London, Helsinki, Lisbon, Dublin, Copenhagen

Shanghai has partnership with:

#### Terminated Partnerships (2)
- **Beijing-Prague** - Terminated 2020 after Prague partnered with Taipei
- **Shanghai-Gothenburg** - Ended due to deteriorating political relations

## Key Findings

### The Reality Check
1. **Actual verified agreements: 26** (not 4,579)
2. **Most are city partnerships**, not national agreements
3. **Only 5 BRI MOUs verified** despite claims of 18
4. **Major EU-China investment deal is frozen**, not active
5. **Italy already withdrew from BRI**, showing reversals happening

### Quality vs Quantity
- Every agreement listed here is **real and verifiable**
- Sources are **official government websites** and databases
- No industrial machinery sites masquerading as agreements
- No language learning websites counted as MOUs
- No casino sites in the database

2. European Parliament records

4. Not trusting automated pattern matching
5. Understanding that diplomatic research requires human judgment
