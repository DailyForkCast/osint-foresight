## 🎯 Honest Assessment

### **Reality Check**:
- **Zero specific bilateral agreements found**
- **7 generic government/diplomatic pages collected**
- **No sister city partnerships documented**
- **No academic cooperation agreements identified**
- **No economic or cultural agreements located**

### **Why This Happened**:
1. **Search engines return general pages** before specific agreement documents
2. **Bilateral agreements are often in PDFs** not well-indexed by search engines
3. **Municipal and university websites** aren't prioritized in search results
4. **Native language content** may not surface in general searches
5. **Specialized databases** require direct access, not web scraping

- Geographic and language barriers limit access

### **Source Access Issues**:
- Government websites often require navigation through multiple pages
- University partnership information typically on internal pages
