## Files

### Italy Executive Brief
**File**: `Italy/ITALY_EXECUTIVE_BRIEF_ORIGINAL.md`
**Date Archived**: 2025-09-14
**Reason**: Temporal non-compliance - contained 2024-2025 recommendations

**Issues Found**:
1. "Immediate (2024-2025)" - past tense timeline
2. "Target: 1.55% GDP by 2025" - too soon (only 3.5 months)
3. "65% compliance by 2025" - unrealistic timeline
4. "Medium-term (2025-2030)" - starts too early
5. "Scenario Outlook (2025-2033)" - should start from 2026
6. "Next Review: Q4 2025" - only weeks away

**Fixed Version Location**: `artifacts/Italy/_national/ITALY_EXECUTIVE_BRIEF.md`

- Budget cycle misunderstanding (FY2025/2026 changes)
- Missing implementation delays
