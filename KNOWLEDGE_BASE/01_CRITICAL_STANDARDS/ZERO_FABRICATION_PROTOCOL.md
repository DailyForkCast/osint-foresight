**Status:** MANDATORY COMPLIANCE

## 🔴 CRITICAL INCIDENT LOG

### Incident 001: Web of Science Fabrication
**Date:** 2025-09-21
**Description:** Claimed "Web of Science has 15% geographic coverage" without any actual data
**Root Cause:** Used "general knowledge" instead of verified data
**Impact:** False information in strategic intelligence report
**Corrective Action:** Removed claim, updated all reports, strengthened protocols
**LESSON:** Even "reasonable estimates" based on "general knowledge" are FABRICATION if not based on actual data in our possession.

### Incident 002: Shell Company Assumptions
**Date:** 2025-09-21
**Description:** Labeled Cayman Islands-registered companies as "shell companies" without evidence
**Root Cause:** Added interpretation to geographic registration fact
**Impact:** Unprofessional analysis with unsubstantiated claims
**Corrective Action:** Changed to "offshore-registered companies," removed interpretive language
**LESSON:** Registration location is a fact; "shell company" is an assumption requiring specific evidence.

## Core Principles

### 1. ABSOLUTE RULE: No Data Without Evidence
- **NEVER** cite data we don't have
- **NEVER** estimate based on "general knowledge"
- **NEVER** infer statistics without actual analysis
- **NEVER** claim access to sources we haven't used

### 2. What Constitutes Fabrication

#### ❌ THESE ARE FABRICATIONS:
- "Web of Science has 15% coverage" (without having the data)
- "Based on industry standards..." (without specific source)
- "Typically these databases..." (generalization without evidence)
- "It's reasonable to assume..." (assumption not fact)
- "Most researchers agree..." (without citations)
- "Approximately X based on similar..." (inference without data)

#### ❌ THESE ARE ASSUMPTIONS (Also Forbidden):
- "Shell companies in Cayman Islands" (assumption about intent)
- "Deceptive VIE structures" (adding motive without evidence)
- "Suspicious offshore registration" (interpretation not fact)
- "High risk due to..." (without specific risk criteria)
- "Network of shell companies" (pattern assumption)

#### ✅ THESE ARE ACCEPTABLE:
- "OpenAlex shows 2-3% coverage" (we analyzed this)
- "We detected 1,732 collaborations" (actual count)
- "Cannot determine due to lack of data" (acknowledging limitation)
- "No data available" (honest assessment)
- "41 companies registered in Cayman Islands" (factual observation)
- "11 companies disclosed VIE structures" (from filings)
- "39 incorporated in jurisdiction with 0% tax" (verifiable fact)

### 3. Verification Requirements

Every claim must have:
1. **Source file/database** - Where did the data come from?
2. **Extraction method** - How was it obtained?
3. **Processing code** - What analysis was performed?
4. **Audit trail** - Can someone reproduce this?

### 4. Language Requirements

#### ❌ FORBIDDEN PHRASES:
- "It is estimated that..."
- "Based on typical patterns..."
- "Industry standards suggest..."
- "Comparable databases show..."
- "We can infer that..."
- "It's reasonable to assume..."

#### ✅ REQUIRED PHRASES:
- "Our data shows..."
- "We detected..."
- "Analysis revealed..."
- "Cannot determine without data"
- "No evidence available"
- "Data not in our possession"

### 5. Handling Unknown Information

When we don't have data:

**WRONG:** "Web of Science likely has 15% coverage"

**CORRECT:** "We do not have Web of Science data. We cannot make claims about its coverage."

**WRONG:** "Similar databases suggest..."

**CORRECT:** "We have no data on this aspect."

### 6. Documentation Standards

Every analysis must document:
```markdown
## Data Source
- Database: [Exact name and version]
- Access Date: [When accessed]
- Files Analyzed: [Specific files]
- Records Processed: [Exact count]

## Limitations
- What we DON'T have: [List]
- What we CAN'T determine: [List]
- Confidence level: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW with justification]
```

### 7. Quality Assurance Checklist

Before any report:
- [ ] Every number traced to source data?
- [ ] Every percentage calculated from our data?
- [ ] Every comparison based on actual analysis?
- [ ] All limitations explicitly stated?
- [ ] No "general knowledge" claims?
- [ ] No unsourced estimates?
- [ ] No fabricated examples?

### 8. Correction Protocol

If fabrication detected:
1. **IMMEDIATE** correction in all documents
2. **LOG** the incident with root cause
3. **DOCUMENT** what was wrong and why
4. **UPDATE** protocols to prevent recurrence
5. **NOTIFY** if report was distributed

### 9. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **The "Reasonable Estimate" Trap**
   - Just because something sounds reasonable doesn't make it true
   - All estimates must be based on actual data

2. **The "Industry Knowledge" Trap**
   - General knowledge about databases is not evidence
   - Each database must be analyzed independently

3. **The "Comparable Systems" Trap**
   - One system's characteristics don't predict another's
   - Each source needs independent verification

4. **The "Missing Data Interpolation" Trap**
   - Don't fill gaps with assumptions
   - Missing data should remain missing

### 10. Enforcement

- **Every team member** responsible for compliance
- **Every report** must pass zero-fabrication review
- **Every claim** must have evidence
- **No exceptions** for "obvious" facts

## Red Flags for Review

Watch for these warning signs:
- Round numbers without source (e.g., "about 15%")
- Comparative claims without both datasets
- Technical specifications without documentation
- Coverage estimates without actual analysis
- Any use of "typically," "usually," "generally"
- Interpretive labels ("shell", "deceptive", "suspicious")
- Intent attribution ("hiding", "circumventing", "avoiding")
- Risk claims without specific criteria
- Pattern claims without statistical analysis

## The Golden Rule

**"If we didn't count it, calculate it, or observe it directly from data in our possession, we cannot claim it."**

## Proper Terminology Guidelines

### Geographic Registration
- ✅ "Registered in [Country]"
- ✅ "Incorporated in [Jurisdiction]"
- ✅ "41 companies with Cayman Islands registration"
- ❌ "Shell companies in [Country]"
- ❌ "Network of shells"

### Operational Status
- ✅ "Reports no employees per 10-K filing"
- ✅ "No revenue reported in financial statements"
- ✅ "Holding company structure per org chart"
- ❌ "Empty shell with no operations"
- ❌ "Dormant entity"

### Corporate Structures
- ✅ "Variable Interest Entity disclosed in filing"
- ✅ "VIE structure noted, common for Chinese listings"
- ✅ "11 companies use VIE structures"
- ❌ "Deceptive VIE structures"
- ❌ "Structures designed to circumvent law"

### Risk Assessment
- ✅ "Offshore registration noted as risk factor"
- ✅ "Chinese operations disclosed"
- ✅ "Jurisdiction has 0% corporate tax rate"
- ❌ "High risk due to suspicious structure"
- ❌ "Red flags detected"

## Incident Prevention

1. **Before writing:** "Do I have data for this?"
2. **While writing:** "Can I show the source?"
3. **After writing:** "Can someone verify this?"
4. **Before publishing:** "Is anything here assumed?"

## Recovery from Violations

1. **Acknowledge the error immediately**
2. **Correct all affected documents**
3. **Document lessons learned**
4. **Strengthen processes**
5. **No blame, focus on improvement**

## Key Principles

**"The facts are interesting enough. We don't need to embellish them."**

A company being registered in Cayman Islands IS valuable intelligence without calling it a "shell."

**"The truth about what we don't know is more valuable than fabricated estimates."**

## Commitment

This protocol exists because:
- **Credibility** depends on accuracy
- **Trust** requires verification
- **Intelligence** needs integrity
- **Decisions** require truth

Every fabrication or assumption, no matter how small or "reasonable," undermines the entire analysis.

## Remember

❌ "Web of Science has 15% coverage" (fabrication - no data)
✅ "We don't have Web of Science data" (truth)

**The truth about what we don't know is more valuable than fabricated estimates.**
