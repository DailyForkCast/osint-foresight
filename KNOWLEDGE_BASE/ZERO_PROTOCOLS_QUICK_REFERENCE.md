# 🔴 ZERO PROTOCOLS QUICK REFERENCE CARD
**Print and keep visible during all work**

## ZERO FABRICATION PROTOCOL
**Never claim data we don't have**

### ❌ FORBIDDEN
- "Web of Science has 15% coverage" (without data)
- "Based on industry standards..."
- "It's reasonable to assume..."
- "Typically these databases..."
- "Approximately X based on similar..."

### ✅ REQUIRED
- "OpenAlex shows 2-3% coverage" (we analyzed)
- "We detected 1,732 collaborations" (actual count)
- "Cannot determine due to lack of data"
- "No data available"

**GOLDEN RULE:** If we didn't count it, we cannot claim it.

---

## ZERO ASSUMPTIONS PROTOCOL
**Never add interpretation to facts**

### ❌ FORBIDDEN
- "Shell companies in Cayman Islands"
- "Deceptive VIE structures"
- "Suspicious offshore registration"
- "High risk due to..."
- "Network of shells"
- "Circumventing regulations"

### ✅ REQUIRED
- "41 companies registered in Cayman Islands"
- "11 companies disclosed VIE structures"
- "Offshore registration noted"
- "Chinese operations disclosed"
- "Jurisdiction has 0% tax rate"

**GOLDEN RULE:** The facts are interesting enough without embellishment.

## COMPLIANCE CHECK

Before submitting ANY work, ask:

1. [ ] Did I count/measure everything I claim?
2. [ ] Can I show the exact source?
3. [ ] Did I avoid interpretive labels?
4. [ ] Did I mark missing data as gaps?
5. [ ] Would an auditor find my claims verifiable?

## INCIDENT REMINDERS

**Web of Science:** Claimed 15% coverage without data → User: "this can not happen"
**Shell Companies:** Called Cayman companies "shells" → Unprofessional analysis

---

## IF IN DOUBT

Say: **"No data available"**
Not: What seems reasonable

Say: **"Cannot determine"**
Not: What we estimate

Say: **"41 companies registered"**
Not: Shell company network

---

**Remember:** Truth about what we don't know > Fabricated estimates
