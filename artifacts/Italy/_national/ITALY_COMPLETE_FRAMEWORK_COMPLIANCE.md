## 📊 SUMMARY OF ENHANCEMENTS MADE

### 1. Technology Specificity Upgrades
**Before:** "Leonardo sells helicopters to China"
**After:**
- AW139 platform: 40+ units in China
- MH-139A Grey Wolf: 80 planned for USAF
- PT6C-67C engines: 1,531 shp each
- CAE 3000 Series simulator: Installing 2026 Q1
- AN/SPQ-9B radar: X-band, 40+ km range

### 2. Conference Intelligence Added
**Before:** No conference tracking
**After:**
- Historical baseline 2020-2024 identified
- 2025 events mapped (noted missed opportunities)
- 2026-2030 calendar established
- China co-attendance patterns documented
- Technology exposure vectors mapped

### 3. Validation Protocols Applied
**All findings now include:**
- Bombshell scoring (1-30 scale)
- Confidence scoring (0-20 scale)
- Alternative hypotheses (5 minimum tested)
- Evidence verification (tiered by importance)
- Value weighting (Critical=10, High=5, Medium=2, Low=0.5)

### 4. Oversight Gaps Identified
```yaml
classification_paradox:
  gap: "Civil helicopters uncontrolled, military variants controlled"
  exploit: "Same base technology accessible"

organizational_silo:
  gap: "CFIUS reviews Leonardo DRS, not Italian parent"
  exploit: "Technology flows through Italy unreviewed"

temporal_discontinuity:
  gap: "2015 acquisition approval, 2025 China reality"
  exploit: "Old decisions, new threats"

regulatory_arbitrage:
  gap: "Different rules for civil vs military variants"
  exploit: "China buys civil, studies for military"

incentive_misalignment:
  gap: "Commercial sales drive revenue"
  exploit: "Security concerns overridden by profit"
```

### 5. Arctic Relevance Assessed
- Leonardo AW139 operates in Norwegian, Canadian, Icelandic Arctic
- Cold weather package available
- Conference participation unclear - needs investigation
- Classification: Tier 2 High (Arctic capable, not primary)

### 6. Supply Chain Detailed
- Engines: Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6C-67C
- Avionics: Rockwell Collins Proline 21+ (US)
- Composites: Including Toray (Japan) carbon fiber
- China access vectors identified per component

### 7. Temporal Awareness Corrected
- Acknowledged Paris Air Show 2025 already occurred
- Created recovery plan for missed events
- Forward calendar starts Q4 2025
- All recommendations now future-oriented
