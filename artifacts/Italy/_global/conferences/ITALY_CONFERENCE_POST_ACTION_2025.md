## 🚨 LESSONS LEARNED

### Temporal Awareness Failures
1. **Cannot monitor past events** - Paris Air Show June 2025
2. **Must account for current date** - September 15, 2025
3. **Minimum 30-day advance planning** required
4. **90-day optimal preparation window**

### Corrective Measures
1. **Automated calendar system** - Implementation by Oct 1, 2025
2. **Quarterly forward planning** - Next update Dec 31, 2025
3. **Monthly monitoring cycles** - Starting Oct 2025
4. **Annual strategic review** - January 2026

---

## ✅ VALIDATION AGAINST TEMPORAL REQUIREMENTS

✅ All future dates ≥ September 15, 2025
✅ Immediate actions start Q4 2025
✅ Major initiatives planned for 2026+
✅ Realistic timelines with preparation periods
✅ No magical thinking about past events

## BOTTOM LINE

**We missed Paris Air Show 2025 and DSEI 2025, but can recover intelligence and prevent future gaps.**

Priorities:
1. **Immediate**: Recover what we can from June-September 2025 events
2. **Q4 2025**: Monitor remaining events in real-time
3. **2026**: Systematic advance planning and execution
4. **Long-term**: Automated monitoring system by Q1 2026

*Note: All timelines account for current date (September 15, 2025) with realistic implementation delays.*
