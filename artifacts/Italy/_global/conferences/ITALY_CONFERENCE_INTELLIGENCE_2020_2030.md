## 🎯 KEY FINDINGS

1. **Leonardo has MAJOR presence at 8+ Tier-1 conferences annually**
2. **China co-attends EVERY major aerospace conference**
3. **Singapore events = perfect triangle formation venue**
4. **2025 Paris Air Show = CRITICAL monitoring requirement**
5. **Helicopter conferences = highest technology transfer risk**

---

## ⚠️ RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions:
1. Establish monitoring for 2025 Paris Air Show (June)
2. Track Leonardo product announcements pre-conference
3. Identify China delegation leaders in advance
4. Document technology demonstrations plan
5. Archive all marketing materials

### Ongoing Requirements:
1. Quarterly conference calendar updates
2. China delegation pattern analysis
3. Technology disclosure assessments
4. Partnership announcement tracking
5. Follow-on meeting monitoring

## BOTTOM LINE

**Conferences are where Leonardo's technology meets Chinese eyes.**

The same AW139 helicopter that flies for the US Air Force is displayed, demonstrated, and discussed at venues where Chinese delegations systematically collect information.

**Every Leonardo conference appearance is a technology transfer opportunity.**
