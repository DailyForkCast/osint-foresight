# Italy — Phase 01 (Setup & Narratives) — CITED Edition v2
**Date:** 2025-09-14
**Mode:** INTEGRATED (artifacts + web)
**Provenance:** mixed (web|artifact)

## 1) Scope snapshot (from artifacts)
- **Priority regions:** Lombardia–Milan; Lazio–Rome; Piemonte–Turin; Campania–Naples; Emilia‑Romagna–Bologna [A1].
- **Tech priorities:** Space & EO; Cybersecurity & Quantum; Naval & maritime; Advanced manufacturing; Green energy [A1].

## 2) Core public narratives to test — with fact‑checks (inline [n])
**A. “Italy is too dependent on Chinese investment and technology.”** Italy formally exited the BRI by **not renewing the 2019 MoU on 2023‑12‑06** [1]; since 2020 it has tightened **Golden Power** screening and the **national cyber‑perimeter** regime (sectoral, risk‑based) rather than imposing blanket vendor bans [2][3]. **Assessment:** *Partly true*—exposure is **selective** and is being managed via case‑by‑case controls and EU toolkits.

**B. “Italy cannot meet the NATO 2% defense target.”** In NATO’s latest official tables (2014–2025 series), Italy remains **below 2% of GDP** in 2025 estimates, with ongoing domestic debate on timelines and accounting scope [4]. **Assessment:** *Directionally true today*, pending policy/budget shifts.

## 3) Anchor cross‑checks (policy claims vs texts)
- **PNRR “5G vendor ban”.** The PNRR sets funding/governance for digital transition but **does not establish vendor‑named telecom bans**; security rules live in DPCM and Golden Power law [5][2].
- **Golden Power “blocks all Chinese tech investments”.** The regime grants **case‑by‑case special powers** (conditions/veto) over strategic sectors; 2022–2023 amendments broadened scope, but **no blanket country ban** exists in the anchor texts [2][6].
- **National cyber strategy bans Chinese software.** The 2020 perimeter and implementing acts are **risk‑based**; no vendor‑named universal software ban appears in the cited anchors [3].

## 4) Analyst judgments (Phase‑1 level)
- **Narrative A (China dependency):** *Partly true.* Controls and governance have materially increased (2019–2024), while exposures persist in niche vectors; overall dependency appears **governable** under present tools [1][2][3]. **Confidence:** Medium.
- **Narrative B (2% target):** *Likely true at present*; trajectory remains below 2% in current NATO tables absent a decisive policy/accounting shift [4]. **Confidence:** Medium‑High.

## 5) Web Research Notes (1–2‑line takeaways with anchors)
- **BRI exit timeline:** Government signalled **non‑renewal** of the 2019 BRI MoU on **2023‑12‑06**; subsequent analysis frames this as alignment with EU/NATO de‑risking [1].
- **Golden Power practice:** Law Decree 21/2012 and later changes capture 5G/cloud and intragroup operations in critical technologies; decisions are **decision‑specific** rather than categorical bans [2][6].
- **Cyber perimeter:** DPCM **131/2020** defines a **risk‑based** national perimeter across telecom/cloud/energy, etc. [3].
- **PNRR:** Digital transition is mission‑funded; telecom security controls live in separate legal anchors [5].

## 6) Tickets for Claude Code (ingest/refresh)
1) **Legal anchors pack (telecom & cyber):** Ingest full texts and metadata for **DPCM 131/2020** and **DL 21/2012 (+ DL 21/2022 Art. 28)**, with `bindingness`, `scope`, `effective_date`, and amendment lineage into `policy_index.json` [2][3].
2) **PNRR mission ledger:** Extract official **Missione 1 — Digitalizzazione** allocations by component/year into `metric_catalog.csv` and `policy_index.json` with `SourceURL` and `LastChecked` [5].
3) **Narrative tracker:** Record claims (“blanket bans”, “BRI dependency”) as `claim_id`s in `phase01_sub5_narratives.json` with `policy_reaction` and `fact_check_url[]` populated from [1][2][3][5].
