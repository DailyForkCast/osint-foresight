- RSS feeds from key sources
- Web scraping for tender sites
- API access where available
- Common Crawl index queries
- Patent database alerts
- Academic paper alerts (Google Scholar, arXiv)

## Cross-Validation Methods

Always verify adoption claims through:
1. Multiple independent sources
2. Financial evidence (revenue, investment)
3. Physical evidence (facilities, products)
4. Human evidence (hiring, expertise)
5. Regulatory evidence (approvals, standards)
6. Competitive evidence (market response)

## Special Considerations for Dual-Use Technologies

Pay special attention to:
- Export control mentions
- Military specifications referenced
