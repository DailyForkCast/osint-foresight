MITIGATION TIME: 8-12 months to implement
PAST RISKS (2024): Focus on mitigation, not prevention
========================================================

## PHASE 8: Risk Assessment & Mitigation Planning

### Objective
Identify and assess technology-related risks from September 2025 baseline, with realistic mitigation timelines.

### Temporal Context for Risk Assessment

**CRITICAL**: All risks must be assessed from current date (Sept 13, 2025) forward:
- **Immediate risks** (Q4 2025 - Q2 2026): Already emerging, need rapid response
- **Near-term risks** (2026-2027): Can begin mitigation planning now
- **Medium-term risks** (2028-2030): Strategic planning horizon
- **Long-term risks** (2031+): Scenario planning and capability development

### Risk Categories with Realistic Timelines

1. **Technology Dependence Risks**
   - Current state: September 2025 baseline
   - Mitigation start: Q4 2025 earliest
   - Alternative suppliers: 12-18 months to qualify
   - Domestic capacity: 24-36 months to build

2. **Supply Chain Vulnerabilities**
   - Assessment date: September 2025
   - Immediate vulnerabilities: Already materialized
   - Diversification timeline: 18-24 months
   - Stockpiling decisions: Q4 2025 for FY2027 budget

3. **Cybersecurity Threats**
   - Current threat level: As of September 2025
   - New defenses: 6-9 months to deploy
   - Staff training: Q1-Q2 2026
   - Full implementation: Q4 2026

4. **Regulatory/Compliance Risks**
   - Current regulations: In force September 2025
   - Upcoming changes: 2026-2027 implementation
   - Compliance preparation: 12 months minimum
   - Full compliance: By 2027

        "accessed_date": "2025-09-13"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Mitigation Planning Requirements

For each identified risk, provide:

1. **Realistic Start Date** (earliest: October 2025)
2. **Implementation Timeline** (minimum 8-12 months)
3. **Budget Cycle** (FY2027 earliest for new funding)
4. **Success Metrics** (measurable by 2027)
5. **Source Documentation** (with exact URLs)

### Critical Date Validations

Before documenting any risk:
- Is the risk forward-looking from Sept 2025?
- Are mitigation timelines realistic (8+ months)?
- Do budget impacts align with FY2027+?
- Are all sources properly cited with exact URLs?

### Example Risk Documentation

**CORRECT Format:**
```
Risk: Critical mineral dependence
Timeline: Vulnerability increases 2026-2027
Mitigation:
- Start: Q4 2025 (planning phase)
- Implementation: 2026-2027
- Completion: 2028 (full alternative supply)
- Budget: FY2027 allocation required

### Output Requirements

All Phase 8 outputs must include:
1. Assessment date: "2025-09-13"
2. Risk horizon: "2026-2031"
3. Mitigation timelines with 8-12 month minimums
4. Budget impacts starting FY2027
5. Exact source URLs with accessed_dates

### Standard Disclaimer
*Risk assessment conducted September 13, 2025. Mitigation timelines assume 8-12 month implementation periods. Budget allocations begin FY2027. Critical vulnerabilities from 2024 focus on mitigation rather than prevention.*
