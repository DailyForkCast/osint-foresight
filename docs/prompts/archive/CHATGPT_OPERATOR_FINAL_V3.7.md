## Phase Flow (0–13) - What to Read and How to Reason

### Phase 0 — Definitions & Taxonomy
Read `phase00_taxonomy.json` (non-exhaustive). Expand via synonyms/acronyms/vendor terms.

**NATO Enhancement**: Include NATO capability taxonomy:
- Joint enablers: ISR, strategic airlift, AAR, SATCOM
- High-end warfare: A2/AD, precision strike, EW, cyber
- Readiness: NRF, VJTF, EFP, air policing
- Emerging tech: AI, quantum, hypersonics, space, biotech

### Phase 1 — Setup & Narratives
Read `phase01_setup.json`, `phase01_sub5_narratives.json`. Compare narrative prevalence vs. facts; identify **policy reactions** and whether they map to verified anchors.

**NATO Context**: Check if narratives relate to:
- Burden-sharing debates
- Article 5 credibility
- Technology sovereignty vs alliance dependency

### Phase 2 — Indicators & Sources
Read `phase02_indicators.json`, `metric_catalog.csv`. Note coverage/latency; ticket rate-limit or coverage gaps.

**NATO Metrics** (if member/partner):
- Defense GDP ratio (2% target)
- Equipment modernization (20% target)
- NATO exercise participation rate
- STANAG implementation status
- COE contributions
- DIANA/NIF participation

### Phase 3 — Landscape (2019–2025)
Read `phase03_landscape.json`, `policy_index.json`, `alias_map.json`.

**If INCLUDE_NATO**, also summarize:
- `phase03_sub4_nato_policies.json` - NATO posture, STANAG adoption, national transposition
- Defense planning alignment with NDPP
- NATO infrastructure hosted
- Framework nation responsibilities

### Phase 4 — Supply Chain
Read `phase04_supply_chain.json`, `supply_chain_map.json`, `procurement_signals.csv`.

**If US toggle**: include `phase04_sub4_us_owned_supply.json`
**If NATO toggle**: include `phase04_sub5_nato_supply_nodes.json` - NSPA/NIAG/NSIP links, STANAG requirements

Key NATO supply considerations:
- NSPA centralized procurement share
- Multinational logistics dependencies
- STANAG compliance for interoperability
- Certification bottlenecks

### Phase 5 — Institutions
Read `phase05_institutions.json`. Integrate **5.5** outliers and **5.6** auto-hub proposals with QA rationale.

**If NATO toggle**, include **5.7**: `phase05_sub7_diana_sites.json` for:
- DIANA accelerator locations
- Test center capabilities
- COE hosting and participation
- NATO Innovation Fund exposure

**Hub-bias disclaimer**: "Non-hub scan covered <regions>; found <Y> outliers; <Z> promoted. Summary weighting reflects hubs and outliers."

### Phase 6 — Funding
Read `phase06_funders.json` + controls map.

**If US toggle**: `phase06_sub6_us_funding_links.json`
**If NATO toggle**: `phase06_sub7_nato_funding_links.json` including:
- DIANA funding
- NATO Innovation Fund investments
- STO research grants
- SPS programme participation
- NSIP infrastructure funding

### Phase 7 — Links
Read `phase07_links.json`, `standards_activity.json`.

**If US toggle**: `phase07_sub4_us_partner_links.json`
**If NATO toggle**:
- `phase07_sub5_nato_links.json` - exercises, COE collaboration, STO projects
- `phase07_sub6_standards_stanag_map.json` - STANAG↔civil standards mapping

NATO collaboration patterns to assess:
- Minilateral formats (JEF, V4, NORDEFCO, B9)
- Framework nation arrangements
- Capability specialization agreements
- Exercise leadership roles

### Phase 8 — Risks
Read `phase08_risk.json`; ensure numeric indicators & VoI hints; build text DAG for mechanisms.

**NATO-specific risks**:
- Article 5 credibility gaps
- Capability shortfalls vs NDPP
- Interoperability failures
- Burden-sharing tensions
- Innovation lag vs EDT priorities

### Phase 9 — PRC/MCF ⚠️ CRITICAL - OFTEN SKIPPED
**MANDATORY**: Read `phase09_posture.json`; consume **9.10** soft-points and **9.11** policy-anchor crosswalk.
**VALIDATION**: Executive brief MUST include China/PRC risk analysis from this phase

**NATO considerations**:
- PRC interest in NATO technologies
- Attempts to divide alliance
- Technology acquisition from NATO members
- Standards influence campaigns

**Inline anchor/standards mismatch note template**:
```
AnchorMismatch: Claim C-012 says "Policy A bans X". 9.11 shows no such anchor (status: none_found).
7.6 maps STANAG-YYYY to ISO-ZZZZ (partial only). → Confidence: Low; Ticket: major.
```

### Phase 10 — Red Team ⚠️ CRITICAL - OFTEN SKIPPED
**MANDATORY**: Read `phase10_redteam.json` + `adversary_plan.json`. Run falsification checks on top-3 conclusions.
**VALIDATION**: Must challenge key assumptions and test alternative hypotheses

**NATO scenarios to test**:
- Article 5 trigger scenarios
- Alliance cohesion under stress
- Technology denial strategies
- Hybrid warfare below threshold

### Phase 11 — Foresight & EWS
Read `phase11_foresight.json`, `forecast_registry.*`, `calibration_scores.json`.

**If US toggle**: `phase11_sub5_compute_data_exposure.json`
**If NATO toggle**: `phase11_sub7_nato_ews.json` including:
- Defense spending trajectories
- Capability target tracking
- Exercise performance metrics
- Innovation ecosystem health
- Alliance solidarity index

NATO early warning thresholds:
- Defense spending < 1.5% for 2+ years
- Missing 2+ major exercises
- STANAG compliance < 70%
- No DIANA/NIF participation

### Phase 12 — Extended ⚠️ CRITICAL - OFTEN SKIPPED
**MANDATORY**: Read `phase12_extended.json` (country-customs).
**VALIDATION**: Must include deep-dive sector analysis, emerging tech assessment, and long-term trajectories

**NATO regional dynamics**:
- Baltic resilience and deterrence
- Black Sea security architecture
- Arctic capabilities and cooperation
- Mediterranean stability
- Central European depth

### Phase 13 — Closeout
Read `phase13_closeout.json` and produce **13.5 Panel** from `phase13_sub5_policy_mismatch_panel.json` + contradictions log.

**NATO considerations for closeout**:
- Alliance commitment sustainability
- Capability development timelines
- Interoperability milestones
- Regional leadership opportunities

## NATO-Specific Assessment Questions

For NATO members, always address:

1. **Strategic Alignment**
   - How aligned are national priorities with NATO EDT?
   - What % of defense R&D supports NATO capabilities?
   - Which multinational programs does the country lead?

2. **Capability Contribution**
   - Is the country meeting NDPP targets?
   - What niche capabilities does it provide?
   - How does it contribute to high readiness?

3. **Innovation Participation**
   - Does it host DIANA sites or COEs?
   - Has it invested in NIF?
   - How many STO projects does it lead?

4. **Industrial Integration**
   - What share of procurement goes through NSPA?
   - How many STANAGs are implemented?
   - Which NIAG groups does it chair?

5. **Regional Leadership**
   - Does it serve as a framework nation?
   - Which minilateral formats does it lead?
   - What regional initiatives does it drive?

## QA & Guardrails

### Evidence Hygiene
- Prefer primary docs; flag paywalled/secondary summaries
- For NATO docs, note classification level
- For 中文 anchors include `{source_lang:"zh-CN", translation_method, reviewer, quality_score}`

### NATO Data Quality Notes
- Defense spending: Use NATO official + SIPRI for validation
- STANAG compliance: Note "implemented", "partial", or "planned"
- Exercise participation: Distinguish observer vs full participant
- COE roles: Differentiate host, sponsor, participant

### Analyst Footnotes
For major inferences, add ≤40-word note explaining judgment and trade-offs.

### Stop-Conditions (Apply During Reading)
- **Phase 3:** If `bindingness` coverage <80% → set synthesis confidence = **Low** and **Ticket**
- **Phase 5.5:** If an outlier has <2 independent sources → do **not** treat as hub-like; **Ticket**
- **Phase 9.11:** If crosswalk mismatch found → insert **Inline AnchorMismatch** note and log for **13.5**
- **NATO:** If defense spending data >2 years old → **Ticket** for update
