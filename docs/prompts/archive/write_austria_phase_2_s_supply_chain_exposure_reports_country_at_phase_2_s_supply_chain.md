author: OSINT Foresight (solo analyst)

## Scope & Inputs
- **Country / ISO2:** Austria (AT) · **Years:** 2015–2025 · **Looser matchers:** ON · **Languages:** en, de
- **Goal:** map critical supply‑chain nodes and exposure vectors relevant to dual‑use technologies.
- **Flex rule:** Narrative and examples scale with reality — a landlocked or small economy may have **0–N** ports/air hubs/nodes; capture what truly exists (no forced counts).
- **Primary files (if present):** `institutions.csv`, `cer_master.csv`, `relationships.csv`, `programs.csv`, optional `sanctions_hits.csv` (signals only; **exclude US persons**).

## A) Critical Nodes & Corridors (today’s view)

| node_id | node_type | name | location | role | relevance_note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | Rail terminal | Wien Süd (example) | Vienna | intermodal/rail | Connects to DE/CZ/SI corridors; used for high‑value electronics |
| N2 | Air cargo hub | Vienna International (VIE) | Schwechat | air cargo | Primary intl cargo gateway; potential route for sensitive shipments |
| N3 | Free zone / customs regime | (if any) | — | customs facilitation | Note FTZ/special procedures if confirmed |

node_id	node_type	name	location	role	relevance_note
N1	rail terminal	Wien Süd (example)	Vienna	intermodal/rail	Connects to DE/CZ/SI corridors; used for high‑value electronics
N2	air cargo hub	Vienna International (VIE)	Schwechat	air cargo	Primary intl cargo gateway; potential route for sensitive shipments
N3	free zone/customs	(if any)	—	customs facilitation	Note FTZ/special procedures if confirmed
```

> **Note:** Austria is land‑locked; seaport exposure is indirect via **Hamburg/Bremerhaven/Koper/Trieste/Rijeka**. List indirect corridors only if substantiated by forwarder/rail operator docs.

## B) Exposure Vectors (mechanisms, label‑independent MCF)

| vector_id | vector_type | description | likely_goods/knowledge | detection_anchor | related_phases | severity_1to3 | likelihood_LMH | confidence_LMH |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| V1 | supplier_relationship | Sensitive components entering via DE/IT/SI logistics | RF modules, timing parts, optics | forwarder routes, customs procedures | P2,P3,P2S | 2 | M | L |
| V2 | data_or_compute_access | Off‑prem compute/testbeds crossing borders | EuroHPC/VSC access patterns | allocations/agreements | P2,P8 | 2 | M | M |
| V3 | standards_influence | International SDO work tilting conformance | test methods, profiles | roster roles; doc contributions | P2,P5,P6 | 2 | L | M |
| V4 | JV/equity/control | Ownership/control affecting key suppliers | equity ties, BO changes | registries (LEI, OpenCorporates) | P2S,P5,P7C | 3 | L | L |

## C) Nodes → Exposure Narrative (flex length)
Write **what actually exists**:
- If **0** seaports: explain the **indirect** corridors (e.g., Hamburg/Koper ↔ rail to AT), carriers, and typical goods classes.
- If multiple nodes (e.g., many inspection sites/air hubs): list all material ones with 1–3 lines each.
- Include **one or more examples** when available (not forced to “one only”).
- Call out **bottlenecks/chokepoints** and any **alternative routes**.

**Example narrative (AT, placeholder):**
Austria’s exposure concentrates in **rail/road intermodal hubs** and **Vienna International Airport (VIE)** for high‑value electronics and precision instruments. Seaport legs are typically fulfilled via **Hamburg** and **Koper**, with rail connections through Germany and Slovenia. For dual‑use subdomains (RF/EMC instrumentation, GNSS/time parts, photonics), the highest‑signal pathways involve EU‑internal customs procedures with trusted forwarders; risk is less about tariff evasion and more about **control/ownership** of critical suppliers upstream and **screening sufficiency** at transshipment points.

## D) Logistics Routes (if known)

| route_id | origin | via | destination | mode | goods_class | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Hamburg (DE) | DE rail | Vienna | sea+rail | electronics/instruments | indirect seaport corridor |
| R2 | Koper (SI) | SI rail | Graz/Vienna | sea+rail | optics/components | alternative southern corridor |

```text
# excel-tsv
route_id	origin	via	destination	mode	goods_class	notes
R1	Hamburg (DE)	DE rail	Vienna	sea+rail	electronics/instruments	indirect seaport corridor
R2	Koper (SI)	SI rail	Graz/Vienna	sea+rail	optiques/components	alternative southern corridor
```

## E) Sanctions/Legal Overlay (signals‑only; **non‑US persons**)
If any logistics operators, forwarders, or shell entities appear on EU/UK/CA/AU/NZ/UN lists, record them in `sanctions_hits.csv` with **source link** and **date**. Treat as **signals only**, not determinations.

---

## F) Lay Summary (why it matters)
Austria’s supply‑chain exposure for dual‑use tech is primarily **inbound via EU partners** and **air cargo through VIE**. The most credible near‑term vectors are **supplier relationships** and **off‑prem compute/testbed access**, rather than direct maritime flows. Monitoring **rail/air nodes**, **ownership changes (LEI/OpenCorporates)**, and **allocation policies** provides early detection. Where evidence is thin, gather targeted forwarder/rail operator documentation to validate corridors.

---

## 3–5 Bullet Executive Summary
- **Land‑locked reality:** Indirect seaport flows via DE/SI/IT; air cargo at VIE is the critical hub.
- **Vectors to watch:** Supplier relationships and **off‑prem compute/testbed** exposure dominate near‑term risk.
- **Evidence next:** Forwarder/rail operator docs; LEI/OpenCorporates merges for ownership control; customs/FTZ procedures if applicable.
- **Policy hooks:** Light‑touch FDI/screening checks for sensitive subdomains; align with EU frameworks.

## Next Data Boost (1 step)
Pull **GLEIF (AT)** and **OpenCorporates (AT)** to create `cer_master.csv` and map top suppliers/forwarders; confirm at least **two** corridors with public operator docs (URLs in EvidenceRegister).
