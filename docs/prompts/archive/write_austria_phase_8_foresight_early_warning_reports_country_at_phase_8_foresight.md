title: "Austria — Phase 8: Foresight & Early Warning (2y/5y/10y)"
author: OSINT Foresight (solo analyst)
date: 2025-09-07
---

## Scope & Inputs
- **Country / ISO2:** Austria (AT) · **Horizons:** 2y / 5y / 10y · **Years considered:** 2015–2025 evidence base  
- **Inputs (if present):** `capability_heat.tsv`, `risk_register.tsv`, `p7c_mo_map.tsv`, `p7c_early_indicators.tsv`, `international_links.tsv`, `programs.csv`, `AccreditedLabs.tsv`, `institutions.csv`, `domain_maturity.tsv`, `funders.tsv`, `instruments.tsv`, `sanctions_hits.csv` (signals‑only; **exclude US persons**).  
- **Method:** Label‑independent dual‑use reasoning (function‑over‑label), cone‑of‑plausibility, explicit uncertainty; evidence‑weighted signals (recency × multiplicity × source quality).

---

## A) Baseline Trajectory (evidence‑weighted)
Summarize the **most likely** trajectory given current evidence. Use cluster IDs from Phase X.

```text
# excel-tsv — data/processed/country=AT/p8_baseline.tsv
cluster_id	cluster_name	2027_outlook_0_3	2030_outlook_0_3	2035_outlook_0_3	drivers	drags	confidence_LMH
C2	High-Performance Computing	3	3	2	EuroHPC/VSC access; EU programs	Capex cycles; governance tightening	M
C1	AI/ML & Autonomy	2	2	2	Compute + events + consortia	Talent competition; small scale	L
C3	Networking/Timing	2	2	2	IETF roles; metrology culture	Niche size; irregular funding	M
C4	Sensing & PNT	1	2	2	Potential GNSS/time benches	Unconfirmed scopes; small market	L
C6	Semiconductors & Electronics	1	1	2	EMC/RED labs anticipated	Evidence thin; OEM presence limited	L
```

> 0 = none/declining; 1 = emerging; 2 = established niche; 3 = strong capability.

---

## B) Alternative Futures (2y/5y/10y)
Develop **three** scenario families: **Upside**, **Baseline**, **Downside**.

```text
# excel-tsv — data/processed/country=AT/p8_scenarios.tsv
scenario_id	horizon	scenario_family	title	short_path	implications	confidence_LMH
S_U2	2y	Upside	"VSC as Regional AI Magnet"	EuroHPC + national push concentrates methods dev in Vienna	More AI co-pubs; software/tooling spillovers	L
S_B5	5y	Baseline	"Measured Growth, EU‑governed"	EU programs sustain HPC/networking niches	Stable standards influence; moderate bench build‑out	M
S_D10	10y	Downside	"Bench Stagnation"	Scopes not realized; funding flat	Dual‑use benches remain thin; less leverage	L
```

Add one **wildcard/black‑swan** if relevant:

```text
# excel-tsv — data/processed/country=AT/p8_wildcards.tsv
wildcard_id	horizon	title	trigger	first_order_effect	second_order_effect
W1	5–10y	"Sudden EU Compute Tightening"	Policy shock at EuroHPC	Reduced external MoUs	Rerouting to private clouds; data locality push
```

---

## C) Early‑Warning Indicators (EWIs) & Thresholds
Operationalize **signposts** that shift probability mass among scenarios. Use **measurable thresholds**.

```text
# excel-tsv — data/processed/country=AT/p8_ewi.tsv
indicator_id	indicator	threshold	favours_scenario	collection_plan	source_hint
E1	EuroHPC/VSC allocation to AT teams	≥ +20% YoY	Upside (2y/5y)	Track annual allocation reports	EuroHPC minutes; center PR
E2	New 17025 scopes in EMC/GNSS	≥ 6 labs with relevant scopes	Upside/Baseline (5y)	Quarterly registry scrape	Akkreditierung Austria
E3	IETF role elevation (IPPM/NTP)	Editor/Chair roles recurring	Upside/Baseline (2y/5y)	Roster diff every release	Datatracker acks
E4	CORDIS AT‑participant wins	≥ +25 projects in Cluster 4/5	Upside (5y)	Annual export + delta	CORDIS API/export
E5	Ownership/JV in suppliers	≥ 2 material BO changes	Downside (control risk)	LEI/OC merge quarterly	GLEIF / OpenCorporates
```

---

## D) Targeting/Attraction Model (PRC‑Relevant) — Signals‑Only
Assess **attraction** of Austrian capabilities to PRC mechanisms from Phase 7C, by horizon.

```text
# excel-tsv — data/processed/country=AT/p8_targeting.tsv
cluster_id	mechanism	2y_attraction_0_3	5y_attraction_0_3	10y_attraction_0_3	rationale
C2	Compute/testbed access	2	2	1	EuroHPC/VSC draw now; governance may tighten later
C3	Standards venue influence	1	2	2	Roles could compound; slow build
C4	Measurement tech procurement	1	2	2	If EMC/GNSS benches grow, tooling becomes valuable
```

> Treat as **signals‑only**; do not infer intent. **Exclude US persons** in any legal overlays.

## E) Intervention Menu (evidence‑linked; optional)
List **light‑weight, realistic** actions a solo analyst can recommend if asked later (not executing now).

```text
# excel-tsv — data/processed/country=AT/p8_interventions.tsv
intervention_id	class	what	why_linked_to_evidence	effort_1to3	owner_hint
I1	Monitoring	Quarterly registry scrape (EMC/GNSS)	Closes Phase‑3/6 evidence gaps	1	Analyst + Claude Code
I2	Governance	Publish allocation transparency request	Tests A1 assumption about compute impact	1	Research org / civil society
I3	Capacity	Standards skills clinic (IPPM/NTP)	Builds benign influence; documents roles	2	University/RTO + SDO mentors
I4	Data hygiene	LEI/OC quarterly merge → CER-lite	Detects BO/control vectors	1	Analyst + scripts
```

## F) Narrative — Outlook & Rationale
**Most plausible arc:** Over **2–5 years**, Austria maintains a **stable niche** in **HPC/networking**, with **AI** enabled by shared compute and cross‑border projects. The decisive swing factor is **evidence of real benches** (EMC/GNSS/photonics). If accreditation scopes materialize in volume, the capability map shifts upward and the attraction model tilts toward **measurement technology**. Standards roles likely **compound slowly**, which favors the baseline in 5–10 years absent shocks.

**Risks & uncertainty:** Allocation opacity and missing bench evidence keep **confidence moderate‑to‑low** in AI and measurement clusters. Ownership/control vectors remain a **low‑likelihood but high‑impact** tail and should be watched via LEI/OC deltas. All sanctions/legal flags remain **signals only** and **exclude US persons**.

---

## G) Executive Summary (3–5 bullets)
- **Baseline:** Stable niche in HPC/networking; AI benefits depend on sustained compute allocations and staffing.
- **Upside triggers:** 6+ new EMC/GNSS scopes; sustained IETF role elevation; CORDIS project growth.
- **Downside triggers:** EU compute tightening; ownership/control shifts in key suppliers; bench stagnation.
- **Next step:** Instrument 5 EWIs with simple scrapers/hand‑checks and revisit every 6 months.

---

## Next Data Boost (1 step)
Implement **five EWIs** as lightweight checks (Datatracker diff, EuroHPC allocation note, accreditation scrape, CORDIS delta, LEI/OC merge) and record results in `p8_ewi.tsv` on a **quarterly** cadence.
