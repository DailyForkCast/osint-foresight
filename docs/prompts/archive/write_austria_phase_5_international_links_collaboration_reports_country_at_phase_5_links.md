title: "Austria — Phase 5: International Links & Collaboration"
author: OSINT Foresight (solo analyst)
date: 2025-09-07

## Scope & Inputs
- **Country / ISO2:** Austria (AT) · **Years:** 2015–2025 · **Languages:** en, de · **Looser matchers:** ON
- **Primary files (if present):** `data/processed/country=AT/relationships.csv`, `standards_roles.tsv`, `programs.csv`, optional `institutions.csv`, `cer_master.csv`, `grant_partners.tsv`, `supply_nodes.tsv`.
- **Guardrails:** Neutral tone; *signals ≠ proof*. **Exclude US persons** from any sanctions/legal overlays. **MCF detection is label‑independent**—flag patterns by function even when the label is absent.
- **Mandatory:** **PRC entities screen** for every salient foreign counterpart (Section E).

## A) Link Types Tracked (how edges form)

| link_type | definition | examples of observables |
|---|---|---|
| Co‑publication / Co‑authorship | Joint papers, shared affiliations on publications | OpenAIRE/Crossref edges; conference programs |
| Co‑project / Funding consortium | Joint grants or EU projects | CORDIS participants; funder program pages |
| Infrastructure/Testbed Access | Shared use or MoUs for HPC, labs, EO ground segment | EuroHPC/VSC access lists; facility MoUs |
| Standards Participation | Co‑authorship, editorships, or WG collaborations | IETF/ETSI rosters; draft acknowledgments |
| Industry JV/Ownership | Equity stakes, BO linkages | GLEIF LEI relationships; OpenCorporates |
| Training/Exchange | Joint schools, PhD exchange, visiting scholars | Univ pages; program flyers |

---

## B) Current Cross‑Border Links (selected)
(Use existing `relationships.csv` and add more as they are collected.)

| sector | counterpart_name | counterpart_country | collab_type | year | why_relevant |
|---|---|---|---:|---|---|
| High‑Performance Computing | EuroHPC LEONARDO | IT | infrastructure | 2024 | Shared EU compute fabric → AI/HPC enablement |
| High‑Performance Computing | EuroCC Slovenia (SLING) | SI | co‑project | 2024 | Regional HPC competence & training ties |
| High‑Performance Computing | Vienna Scientific Cluster (VSC) | AT | infrastructure | 2024 | National backbone; hub for external collaborations |
| AI/ML | University of Tübingen | DE | co‑publication | 2023 | Cross‑border AI research link |

# excel-tsv — data/processed/country=AT/international_links.tsv

```

> Add further links as discovered (e.g., ISTA ↔ UT Austin/CMU/UChicago; Max Planck; imec; Oxford) and capture the **evidence IDs** in the Evidence Register.

## C) Collaboration Heat (0–3) by Country/Cluster
Score by **edge count × recency × diversity (link types)**. Use it to guide vignettes and PRC screen.

```text
# excel-tsv — data/processed/country=AT/phase5_heat.tsv
country	cluster_id	cluster_name	heat_0_3	last_signal	why
DE	C1	AI/ML & Autonomy	2	2023-12	Co-pubs + events (ICLR Vienna)
IT	C2	High-Performance Computing	2	2024-06	EuroHPC LEONARDO link
SI	C2	High-Performance Computing	2	2024-06	EuroCC collaboration/training
```

## D) Extended Narrative — International Links & Why They Matter
Austria’s cross‑border collaboration pattern is anchored by **EU compute infrastructure (EuroHPC, VSC)** and **near‑neighbor knowledge ties**. In **HPC**, the **LEONARDO** linkage and **EuroCC Slovenia** show practical cooperation on compute and training, which in turn enables **AI/ML** workloads and methods development. Within **networking/timing**, named authorship in **IETF IPPM/NTP** indicates participation in performance metrics and time sync—technical areas that influence conformance and deployment practice across borders. Co‑publications with German institutions (e.g., **University of Tübingen**) underscore a broader DACH knowledge corridor in AI.

From a dual‑use standpoint, these edges can be **capability conduits**: compute allocations, test method diffusion via standards, and co‑project design choices steer what gets built and tested. The risk dimension is not the link itself but **asymmetry** (where one side accumulates leverage) and **downstream use** (e.g., timing/EMC/GNSS functions that can enable sensitive systems). Thus, we track **function‑over‑label** cues, triangulated with accreditation scopes and funder programs.

---

## E) **Mandatory** PRC Entities Screen
For every salient foreign counterpart (non‑AT) in `international_links.tsv`, perform a **PRC entity screen** and record **signals‑only** results in `prc_screen.tsv`. Use open lists: PRC SOE/defense holdings, MOE “national key labs,” CAS/CETC/AVIC/NORINCO/NUDT ecosystems, known front entities, and official PRC ministry/industry associations. **Exclude US persons entirely.**

```text
# excel-tsv — data/processed/country=AT/prc_screen.tsv
counterpart_name	counterpart_country	flag_type	evidence_ref	why_it_matters	notes
EuroHPC LEONARDO	IT	none	—	EU infrastructure JV; routine PRC risk low	—
University of Tübingen	DE	none	—	Academic link; screen faculty labs if escalation occurs	—
```

> If a PRC nexus is suggested (ownership, joint lab, affiliate, standardization MoU), capture the **source URL** in the Evidence Register and summarize it here as a **signal**, not a determination.

---

## F) Vignettes (1–5 relationships of interest)
Write ~120‑word vignettes for the **top 1–5** relationships that are either **promising** or **concerning**. If none are concerning, say so.

```text
# excel-tsv — data/processed/country=AT/phase5_vignettes.tsv
rank	counterpart_name	counterpart_country	vignette_type	vignette_120w	rationale	evidence_refs
1	EuroHPC LEONARDO	IT	promising	(120w narrative on compute access, software co-dev, guardrails)	EU governance; access benefits	[EuroHPC_node]
2	EuroCC Slovenia (SLING)	SI	promising	(120w narrative on training pipeline, regional competence growth)	Human capital; curriculum sharing	[EuroCC_SI]
3	University of Tübingen	DE	neutral	(120w on cross-pub edges, topic alignment, next checks)	AI method links	[Pub_edge_2023]
```

---

## G) Sanctions/Legal Overlay (signals‑only; **non‑US persons**)
If any counterpart (or its parent) appears on **EU/UK/CA/AU/NZ/UN** lists, record in `sanctions_hits.csv` with explicit source links and dates. Treat as **signals only**. **Do not** include US persons.

---

## H) Lay Summary (3–5 bullets)
- **EU fabric first:** EuroHPC/VSC and near‑neighbor projects anchor Austria’s international profile.
- **Standards influence:** IETF authorship in IPPM/NTP adds soft power in deployment practices.
- **Risk posture:** Focus on **asymmetries** and **function‑over‑label** dual‑use cues; apply the **mandatory PRC screen** to all salient counterparts.
- **Next lifts:** CORDIS co‑project export and accreditation scope capture will sharpen link types and depth.

---

## Next Data Boost (1 step)
Run a **CORDIS export** for AT‑participant projects (2015–2025) to enrich `international_links.tsv` and populate new vignettes. Then extend the **PRC screen** to the new counterparts with evidence IDs.
