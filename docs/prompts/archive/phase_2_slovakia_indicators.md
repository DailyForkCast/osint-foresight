# Phase X – Slovakia (Phase 0)

## Executive summary (Phase 0 • Slovakia • 2015–present)

- **Core tech base.** Slovakia is an “Emerging Innovator” in the EU with performance at ~65% of the EU average (2024), improving modestly but with structural weaknesses in human capital that worsened again in 2025. Strengths include exports of medium/high-tech goods and growing participation in EU instruments; gaps include tertiary education and new doctorate output.
- **Dual-use hotspots to watch (2025–2030).**
  1) **Electro-chemistry & batteries → defense UAS & energy storage.** InoBat’s rapid scale-up and **Gotion–InoBat Batteries (GIB)** JV (Chinese SOE-linked parent Gotion High-Tech) align Slovakia with Europe’s battery supply-chain build-out. Government signed an investment agreement (June 20, 2024) for a €1.2 bn plant targeting 20 GWh, production start 2027. In 2025, InoBat also announced a **military-drone battery** (E10) with short-charge, higher-payload claims—explicit dual-use potential.
  2) **Cyber/AI stack.** Slovakia hosts **ESET** (global endpoint-security vendor) and university labs working in AI/robotics (e.g., TU Košice). These assets intersect with EU NIS2-driven critical-sector security obligations.
  3) **Microelectronics/IPCEI.** National planning explicitly references IPCEI-Microelectronics actions and funding channels (Digital Decade roadmap), implying pathways for sensitive supply-chain integration.
- **PRC touchpoints (licit/gray).** The **GIB** JV embeds PRC industrial capital and technology transfer into a strategic Slovak sector; Chinese-language state/industry media celebrate the Slovakia plant as a flagship of PRC-CEE “new energy” cooperation. Presence of a **Confucius Institute at Comenius University (Bratislava)** is an enduring soft-power vector.
- **Governance & controls.** Slovakia has **transposed NIS2** (Act No. 366/2024, effective Jan 1, 2025) and maintains EU dual-use regimes (Reg. 2021/821) within EU sanctions architecture; BIS rules apply to U.S.-origin tech. National Cyber Security Authority (NBU) is the NIS2 hub.
- **Phase-forward implications.**
  - Prioritize **battery/chemistry-to-defense** link mapping (funding, IP, supplier pedigrees; JV governance; export-control exposure).
  - Map **AI/cyber** talent & contracts (ESET ecosystems; TU Košice & other labs; Horizon Europe wins).
  - Track **IPCEI-Microelectronics** calls and awardees; screen for third-country dependencies.

## Findings (scoping grid for downstream phases)

1) **R&I landscape anchors.**
   - **Slovak Academy of Sciences (SAV/SAS)** remains the core basic-research node with active institutes; 2024–25 releases indicate continuing campus transformation and project activity.
   - **University nodes in dual-use-adjacent domains:** **TU Košice** (AI/robotics/cybernetics) with explicit research tracks in AI, intelligent systems, cloud robotics; other faculties cover electronics/telecoms and automotive electronics.

2) **Battery–defense convergence.**
   - **Policy & investment:** Government-backed **GIB** gigafactory (20 GWh) slated for 2027 start; state aid package approved (subsidies + tax breaks).
   - **Defense-leaning productization:** **InoBat E10** battery for military UAS announced May 2025, targeting rapid charge and extended range (explicit defense application).
   - **Narrative in PRC media:** Chinese sources frame the Slovakia plant as deepening **中斯新能源合作** and list corporate-control details of project vehicles.

3) **Cyber/AI exposure & obligations.**
   - **ESET** HQ in Bratislava is a high-value corporate node; sectoral NIS2 obligations and supply-chain dependencies merit review (export-controlled tooling, telemetry, ML models).
   - **Legal baseline:** NIS2 transposed; NBU maintains the public NIS2 portal; private briefings confirm Act 366/2024 in force.

4) **Microelectronics/IPCEI runway.**
   - Digital Decade roadmap includes **IPCEI-Microelectronics** calls and admin processes (NIKA/ISPO) — downstream project lists should be pulled in Phase 2.

5) **PRC influence/education vectors.**
   - **Confucius Institute (Comenius Univ., Bratislava)** active with 2025 programming; include in stakeholder/risk registry and track staffing/partners.

6) **EU programme participation baselines.**
   - **Horizon Europe country profile** & comparative report provide the starting dataset to extract Slovak coordinators, success rates, and thematic distribution (Phase 2 task).

7) **Export controls & sanctions interfaces.**
   - **EU dual-use regime (2021/821)** applies; 2024–25 updates adjust brokering and Russia/Iran targeting; U.S. BIS rules matter for re-exports. (Compile Slovak competent-authority contacts in Phase 2.)
