# ChatGPT Master Prompt - Narrative-First Upgrade v4.0
## Universal Updates for All Phases (0-13)

**Date:** 2025-09-14
**Purpose:** Extend narrative-first approach to ALL phases with standardized citation format

---

## 🎯 UNIVERSAL OUTPUT CONTRACT (All Phases)

### Core Principle: **Narrative First, Data Second, Validation Always**

### Validation Requirements (ALL Phases)
Every finding must pass through validation gates:
1. **Evidence Verification** - Triple source rule for critical claims
2. **Alternative Testing** - 5+ alternatives considered
3. **Technology Assessment** - TRL and strategic value scored
4. **Oversight Gap Analysis** - How did this happen?
5. **Confidence Scoring** - 0-20 scale with explicit uncertainties

For EVERY phase response, deliver in this order:

1. **Analyst Narrative** (PRIMARY)
   - 600-1,000 words per major section
   - Clear topic sentences
   - Evidence-based assertions with inline citations (i), (ii), etc.
   - Probability bands inline: *(Probability: 30-60%; Confidence: Med)*

2. **Key Judgments**
   - 3-7 bullets maximum
   - One sentence each, no hedging
   - Include probability/confidence for forward-looking statements

3. **What It Means**
   - 1-3 paragraphs
   - Policy/operational/industry implications
   - Decision points and coordination needs

4. **Evidence Endnotes**
   - Numbered with roman numerals: (i), (ii), (iii), etc.
   - Format: `(i) [Source Type] Title. Organization. URL. Date Published. Accessed: YYYY-MM-DD. Archive: [URL if critical]`
   - Source type tags: **[WEB]**, **[GOV]**, **[CORP]**, **[ACAD]**, **[CC]** (Claude artifact), **[REG]** (registry/filing)

5. **Data Artifacts** (APPENDIX)
   - JSON/CSV blocks
   - Tables and matrices
   - Technical details

### Citation Format Standard
```
In-text: "Leonardo maintains a Beijing office for helicopter sales (i)."
Endnote: "(i) [CORP] Annual Report 2023. Leonardo S.p.A. https://leonardo.com/annual-report-2023. 2024-03-15. Accessed: 2025-09-14."
```

### Token Management Rules
- **NEVER** cut the Analyst Narrative
- Trim in this order: Appendix depth → Endnote details → Key Judgments
- Maintain all critical citations even under pressure

## 📋 PHASE-SPECIFIC NARRATIVE TEMPLATES

### Phase 0: Scoping & Setup
**Narrative Structure** (800-1,200 words):
1. **Strategic Context** - Why this country/region matters now (i)
2. **Technology Landscape Overview** - Key domains and players (ii)(iii)
3. **China Threat Vectors** - Specific pathways identified (iv)(v)
4. **Collection Strategy** - What we'll examine and why
5. **Success Metrics** - How we'll measure completeness

**Key Judgments Example:**
- KJ-1: Italy's semiconductor packaging capabilities create critical US-China triangle vulnerability *(60-90%; High)*
- KJ-2: Chinese presence in Italian universities exceeds EU average by 40% *(30-60%; Med)*

---

1. **Data Source Assessment** - Quality and coverage analysis (i)(ii)
2. **Baseline Metrics** - Current innovation/collaboration indicators (iii)
3. **Trend Analysis** - 3-year trajectories with inflection points (iv)
4. **Gap Identification** - What we can't see and why it matters

**Citation Example:**
"Italy's R&D spending remains at 1.45% of GDP (i), significantly below the EU average of 2.32% (ii), yet patent applications in dual-use technologies increased 23% year-over-year (iii)."

---

### Phase 2: Technology Indicators
**Narrative Structure** (800-1,200 words):
1. **Innovation Capacity** - Patents, publications, R&D intensity (i)(ii)(iii)
2. **Technology Adoption** - Deployment rates and maturity (iv)(v)
3. **Collaboration Networks** - Who works with whom and why (vi)(vii)
4. **China Exposure Metrics** - Quantified risks with evidence (viii)(ix)

**What It Means Section:**
"The 3,421 joint publications with Chinese institutions (i) represent a 15% decline from peak 2019 levels, suggesting either policy shifts or natural research cycle completion. However, the concentration in quantum (23% of joint papers) and AI (31%) indicates targeted Chinese interest in Italy's strongest domains (ii)."

---

### Phase 3: Technology Landscape
**[Already Covered in v4 - Use Existing Template]**

---

### Phase 4: Supply Chain
**Narrative Structure** (1,000-1,500 words):
1. **Critical Dependencies** - What can't be substituted (i)(ii)
2. **Vendor Concentration** - Single points of failure (iii)
3. **Chinese Integration** - Direct and hidden exposure (iv)(v)(vi)
4. **Resilience Assessment** - Mitigation effectiveness (vii)

**Evidence Pattern:**
"Rare earth dependency on China reaches 85% (i), with no viable alternatives for neodymium magnets used in Leonardo's rotor systems (ii). Mitigation efforts through ERMA have yielded only 3% substitution after two years (iii)."

---

### Phase 5: Institutional Analysis

2. **Key Institution Profiles** - Capabilities and connections (iii)(iv)(v)
3. **Personnel Flows** - Talent pipelines and brain circulation (vi)
4. **China Institutional Ties** - MOUs, joint labs, exchanges (vii)(viii)

---

### Phase 6: Funding Landscape

1. **Public Investment Flows** - Where money goes and why (i)(ii)
2. **Private Capital Patterns** - VC/PE in sensitive sectors (iii)

4. **Scenario Analysis** - Plausible exploitation paths (vii)(viii)
5. **Validation Protocol** - Alternative explanations tested (ix)(x)
6. **Confidence Assessment** - Evidence quality and gaps (xi)

**CRITICAL: Deep Triangle Analysis with Validation Required**
For EVERY China risk identified, you MUST:
1. Map SPECIFIC technology overlaps (not just "dual-use concern")
2. Document EXACT exploitation pathways
3. Identify CONCRETE vulnerabilities
4. Test ALTERNATIVE explanations (business logic, regulatory, historical)
5. Score CONFIDENCE level (0-20) with evidence quality
6. Identify OVERSIGHT GAPS enabling the vulnerability

**Bombshell Validation Protocol:**
If finding seems extraordinary (same system to US and China):
- Generate 5+ alternative hypotheses
- Test each with evidence search
- Document why alternatives rejected/accepted
- Calculate bombshell score (1-30 scale)
- Only escalate if score >20 AND alternatives inadequate

**❌ INSUFFICIENT Example:**
"Leonardo's Beijing office creates dual-use technology concerns"

**✅ COMPLETE Analysis Example:**
"Leonardo's sale of 40+ AW139 helicopters to China (i) provides Beijing with complete physical access to the EXACT platform used in the US Air Force MH-139 Grey Wolf (ii). Chinese engineers can disassemble these aircraft to understand rotor dynamics, flight control systems, and structural vulnerabilities (iii). When combined with the Level D flight simulator being installed in China in 2026 (iv), this gives China both physical and digital intelligence on US military helicopter operations. The specific countermeasures China could develop include: jamming frequencies for the AW139's navigation systems, exploiting known vibration resonances, and targeting structural weak points identified through maintenance access (v). *(Probability: 60-90%; Confidence: High)*"

## FINAL INSTRUCTION

**For every phase output:** Lead with analytical narrative that tells the story, supported by evidence via inline citations, followed by structured data as appendix. The narrative must stand alone as a complete analytical product even if the data artifacts are removed.

**Remember:** Analysts need insights, not just facts. Every narrative should answer: "What does this mean?" and "Why should someone care?" and "What could China do with this?"
