  - Exact same product/system
  - Shared platform/base
  - Technology family
  - No overlap

#### Access Assessment

## 🎯 ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS CHECKLIST

### Must Generate & Test (minimum 5):

#### 1. Business Logic
- [ ] Normal profit motive?
- [ ] Market competition?
- [ ] Customer demand?
- [ ] Standard practice?

#### 2. Regulatory
- [ ] Legal requirement?
- [ ] Compliance driven?
- [ ] Tax optimization?
- [ ] Trade agreement?

#### 3. Historical
- [ ] Pre-existing relationship?
- [ ] Legacy arrangement?
- [ ] Different era decision?
- [ ] Being phased out?

#### 4. Technical
- [ ] Different products?
- [ ] Various configurations?
- [ ] Generation gaps?
- [ ] Capabilities differ?

#### 5. Misinterpretation
- [ ] Translation error?
- [ ] Context missing?
- [ ] Assumption wrong?
- [ ] Data mistake?

### Testing Protocol:
1. List all hypotheses
2. Assign prior probabilities
3. Identify discriminating evidence
4. Collect evidence
5. Update probabilities
6. Document conclusion

## 📋 OVERSIGHT GAP IDENTIFICATION

### For Every Vulnerability Found:

#### Gap Type Assessment
- [ ] **Organizational silo** - Agencies not talking
- [ ] **Temporal discontinuity** - Old decision, new reality
- [ ] **Classification paradox** - Can't connect dots
- [ ] **Regulatory arbitrage** - Exploiting rule differences
- [ ] **Incentive misalignment** - Everyone wins but security

#### Gap Analysis Requirements
- [ ] **How formed** - Historical evolution
- [ ] **Why persists** - Current incentives
- [ ] **Who benefits** - Stakeholder mapping
- [ ] **Fix difficulty** - Barriers to closure
- [ ] **Exploitation risk** - China awareness level

## 🚨 BOMBSHELL SCORING (When Finding Seems Extraordinary)

### Calculate Score (1-5 each, 30 max):

| Factor | Score | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Sameness** | ___ | How identical is technology? |
| **Impact** | ___ | Damage to US interests? |
| **Intent** | ___ | Deliberate or accidental? |
| **Awareness** | ___ | Who knows about this? |
| **Alternatives** | ___ | Other explanations viable? |
| **Evidence** | ___ | How solid is proof? |
| **TOTAL** | ___/30 | |

### Interpretation:
- 25-30: DEFINITE BOMBSHELL - Escalate immediately
- 20-24: PROBABLE BOMBSHELL - Investigate further
- 15-19: SIGNIFICANT FINDING - Document carefully
- 10-14: NOTEWORTHY - Include in analysis
- 5-9: ROUTINE - Standard risk

### Before Declaring Bombshell:
- [ ] Score calculated >20
- [ ] Alternatives inadequate to explain
- [ ] Evidence triple verified
- [ ] Archive captures complete
- [ ] Peer review if possible
- [ ] Language measured (not alarmist)

## 💡 QUALITY EXAMPLES

### ❌ INSUFFICIENT:
```
"Company X works with China (concern)"
"Dual-use technology risks"
"May benefit Chinese military"
```

### ✅ COMPLETE:
```
"Company X sells [EXACT PRODUCT] giving China [SPECIFIC CAPABILITY]"
"TRL 7 [TECHNOLOGY] sold to both [US PROGRAM] and [CHINESE ENTITY]"
"Physical access to [NUMBER] units enables [SPECIFIC COUNTERMEASURE]"
```
