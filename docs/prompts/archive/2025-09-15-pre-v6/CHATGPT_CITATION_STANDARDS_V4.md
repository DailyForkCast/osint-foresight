### Phase 10: Red Team
**Special Citation Needs:**

**Contrarian Citation:**
"While the mainstream assessment suggests vulnerability (i)(ii)(iii), alternative indicators (iv)(v) suggest resilience may be understated."

---

### Phase 11: Foresight
**Special Citation Needs:**
- Trend projections need historical data
- Weak signals need multiple observations
- Scenarios need precedent cases

**Forward-Looking Citations:**
"Based on current trajectories (i)(ii) and early indicators (iii)(iv), the probability of Chinese acquisition attempts increases to 60-90% within 24 months (v)."

---

### Phase 12: Extended Analysis
**Special Citation Needs:**
- Deep dives need primary sources
- Cross-domain links need multiple touchpoints
- Hidden connections need evidence chains

**Deep Dive Citation:**
"Examination of procurement records (i), patent filings (ii), and conference attendance (iii) reveals previously unidentified collaboration between entities A and B (iv)."

**Special Citation Needs:**
- Summary findings need backward references
- Recommendations need supporting precedents
- Gaps need specific missing data points

**Closeout Citation Pattern:**

## 📊 PHASE OUTPUT EXAMPLE

### Phase 4: Supply Chain Analysis - Italy
**Narrative** (850 words)

Italy's technology supply chain reveals three critical vulnerabilities that create exploitable pathways for Chinese technology acquisition and potential disruption of US defense programs (i).

The most acute dependency centers on rare earth elements, where Italy sources 85% of requirements from Chinese suppliers (ii), with no viable substitution for neodymium-iron-boron magnets used in Leonardo's rotor systems and Fincantieri's electric propulsion units (iii). This dependency extends beyond raw materials to processed components, where Chinese companies control 78% of the global refining capacity (iv)...

[Narrative continues with inline citations throughout]

**Key Judgments**
- KJ-1: Chinese rare earth control provides immediate leverage over Italian defense production *(Probability: 60-90%; Confidence: High)*
- KJ-2: Semiconductor packaging dependency creates hidden vulnerabilities in claimed "European" chips *(Probability: 30-60%; Confidence: Medium)*
- KJ-3: Current mitigation efforts will reduce China dependency by maximum 15% within 24 months *(Probability: 60-90%; Confidence: Medium)*

**What It Means**
The supply chain analysis reveals that Italy's defense industrial base remains critically dependent on Chinese-controlled materials and components despite awareness of the risk. This creates immediate leverage for Beijing during any Taiwan contingency and longer-term technology transfer opportunities through maintenance and technical support requirements. Italian policymakers must choose between accepting continued vulnerability or paying the economic and performance costs of supply chain reorganization.
