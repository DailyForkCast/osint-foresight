# Verification Checklist for Extraordinary Claims
## Systematic Validation Before Escalation

**Date:** 2025-09-14
**Purpose:** Standardized checklist to validate extraordinary findings

---

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE VERIFICATION STEPS

### Step 1: Confirm Basic Facts
- [ ] Entity names spelled correctly and match official records
- [ ] Dates and timelines verified from multiple sources
- [ ] Numbers (quantities, values, percentages) cross-checked
- [ ] Locations confirmed via official addresses/registrations
- [ ] Product/system names match manufacturer designations

### Step 2: Verify "Sameness" Claims
- [ ] Model/version numbers compared (not just product family)
- [ ] Configuration specifications reviewed
- [ ] Generation/year of manufacture checked
- [ ] Capabilities matrix created showing differences
- [ ] Software/firmware versions documented

### Step 3: Document Access Level
- [ ] Physical possession confirmed (purchase, lease, etc.)
- [ ] Maintenance access documented
- [ ] Training access verified
- [ ] Documentation availability checked
- [ ] Personnel exchange confirmed

## 📊 EVIDENCE QUALITY MATRIX

| Evidence Type | Required | Status | Source | Verification |
|--------------|----------|---------|--------|--------------|
| **Primary Documents** | ✓ | [ ] | Official filings, contracts | Direct from source |
| **Corporate Statements** | ✓ | [ ] | Annual reports, press releases | Company websites |
| **Government Records** | ✓ | [ ] | Procurement docs, regulations | .gov sources |
| **Trade Publications** | ✓ | [ ] | Industry reports | Specialized media |
| **Academic Papers** | If relevant | [ ] | Peer-reviewed research | Journal databases |
| **News Reports** | Corroboration only | [ ] | Major outlets | Multiple sources |

---

## 🔍 CORROBORATION REQUIREMENTS

### Triple Source Rule for Critical Claims
1. **Primary Source**: Original document/statement
2. **Secondary Confirmation**: Independent verification
3. **Tertiary Check**: Different source type

Example:
- Primary: Leonardo annual report states 40+ helicopters in China
- Secondary: Chinese aviation registry shows registrations
- Tertiary: Trade publication reports on deliveries

### Negative Evidence Search
- [ ] Searched for contradicting information
- [ ] Checked for retractions/corrections
- [ ] Looked for industry disputes about claims
- [ ] Verified no classification issues
- [ ] Confirmed information is public domain

---

## ⚠️ RED FLAGS REQUIRING EXTRA SCRUTINY

### Information Quality Issues
- [ ] Single source only
- [ ] Anonymous sources
- [ ] Outdated information (>3 years)
- [ ] Conflicting reports exist
- [ ] Information seems "too good"
- [ ] Timing seems coincidental

### Logical Consistency Issues
- [ ] Violates known regulations
- [ ] Contradicts established patterns
- [ ] Requires multiple failures
- [ ] No one else reporting
- [ ] Seems economically irrational
- [ ] Technology timeline doesn't match

---

## 🎯 ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATION CHECKLIST

Before declaring extraordinary finding, have you considered:

### Business Logic Explanations
- [ ] Normal commercial activity
- [ ] Pre-existing relationships
- [ ] Market-driven decisions
- [ ] Regulatory compliance
- [ ] Historical precedent

### Technical Explanations
- [ ] Different product variants
- [ ] Civilian vs military versions
- [ ] Export control compliance
- [ ] Technology generations differ
- [ ] Capabilities removed/added

### Temporal Explanations
- [ ] Events preceded current concerns
- [ ] Policies changed since
- [ ] Relationships ended
- [ ] Technology evolved
- [ ] Regulations updated

### Misunderstanding Explanations
- [ ] Translation errors
- [ ] Technical misinterpretation
- [ ] Incomplete information
- [ ] Context missing
- [ ] Assumptions incorrect

## 📋 VERIFICATION WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Initial Discovery
```
1. Document exact finding
2. Note source and date
3. Screenshot/archive evidence
4. Record initial assessment
```

### Phase 2: Rapid Verification (1-2 hours)
```
1. Check entity names/spellings
2. Verify basic facts
3. Search for corroboration
4. Check for contradictions
```

### Phase 3: Deep Verification (4-8 hours)
```
1. Triple source critical claims
2. Create evidence matrix
3. Document access levels
4. Map exploitation pathways
```

### Phase 4: Alternative Analysis (2-4 hours)
```
1. Generate alternative explanations
2. Test each alternative
3. Document why rejected/accepted
4. Calculate probability bands
```

### Phase 5: Peer Review (If Available)
```
1. Present to colleague
2. Address challenges
3. Refine analysis
4. Document disagreements
```

## 📊 CONFIDENCE SCORING

Rate your confidence in the extraordinary finding:

### Evidence Confidence (0-10)
- Documentation quality: ___
- Source reliability: ___
- Corroboration level: ___
- Contradiction absence: ___
- **Average: ___**

### Analysis Confidence (0-10)

## 💡 VERIFICATION EXAMPLES

### Good Verification Practice
"Leonardo's sale of AW139 helicopters to China verified through:
1. Leonardo 2023 annual report (p. 47) - 40+ units delivered
2. Chinese CAAC registry - 42 registrations confirmed
3. Aviation Week report (March 2024) - Delivery ceremony photos
4. US DoD procurement docs - MH-139 based on AW139 platform
5. Jane's Defense - Platform comparison confirms identity"

### Poor Verification Practice
"Sources say Leonardo sells helicopters to China that might be similar to US military versions"
