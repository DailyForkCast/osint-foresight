## REMEMBER

**Today's PhD thesis is tomorrow's startup, next week's conference track, and next decade's industry.**

**Watch where China sends delegations today to predict where they'll compete tomorrow.**

**The absence of conferences in a hot field may indicate classification or competition.**

**Technology convergence creates new conference categories - watch the intersections.**

**By the time a conference exists, the technology race is already half-run.**
