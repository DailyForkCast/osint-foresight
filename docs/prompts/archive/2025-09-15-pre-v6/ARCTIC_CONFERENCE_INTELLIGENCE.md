# Arctic Technology Conference Intelligence Framework
## Critical Domain for Great Power Competition

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-09-14
**Purpose:** Track Arctic technology conferences as strategic competition venues
**Importance:** Arctic = Future conflict zone + resource competition + tech testing ground

---

## 🎯 WHY ARCTIC CONFERENCES MATTER

**"The Arctic is where climate change, resource competition, and military technology converge."**

Critical because:
- **Dual-use everything:** All Arctic tech has military applications
- **Limited access:** Few countries have Arctic capability
- **China's push:** "Near-Arctic state" narrative + Polar Silk Road
- **Technology testbed:** Extreme conditions drive innovation
- **Resource race:** Rare earths, oil, gas, fishing rights
- **New routes:** Northern Sea Route control
