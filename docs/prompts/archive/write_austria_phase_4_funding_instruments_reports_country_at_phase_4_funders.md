## Scope & Inputs
- **Country / ISO2:** Austria (AT) · **Years:** 2015–2025 · **Languages:** en, de · **Looser matchers:** ON
- **Primary files (if present):** `data/processed/country=AT/programs.csv`, `relationships.csv`, optional `funders.tsv`, `instruments.tsv`, `calls.tsv`, `grant_partners.tsv`.
- **Guardrails:** Neutral tone; *signals ≠ proof*. **Exclude US persons** from any sanctions/legal overlays. **MCF detection is label‑independent**—tie to mechanisms (funding focus, eligibility, international partners) rather than labels.

## F) Lay Narrative (expanded)
Austria’s funding landscape is anchored by **FFG (applied R&D)**, **FWF (basic research)**, and **aws (innovation/SME)**, with the **AI Mission Austria** signaling coordination across these bodies for AI development and adoption. At the European layer, **Horizon Europe** (via **CORDIS**) and **EuroHPC JU** shape cross‑border projects and compute‑adjacent R&I. Instruments span **thematic calls**, **basic grants**, **innovation finance** (including guarantees or loans), and **consortia‑based EU actions**.

For dual‑use analysis, **instruments act as vectors**: they govern **who can collaborate**, **what topics are prioritized**, and **where testbeds/facilities are funded**. Tracking program **topic tags**, **eligibility**, and **consortium membership** allows us to infer **capability build‑up** in AI/HPC, networking/timing, sensing/PNT, and advanced manufacturing. **MCF‑consistent** patterns will not be labeled as such in documentation; instead, we look for **function‑over‑label** cues—e.g., funding for timing synchronization testbeds, RF/EMC conformity infrastructure, or GNSS calibration labs—then triangulate with standards roles and accredited scopes.

Where evidence is thin, focus on **two fast lifts**: (1) export **AT‑participant** projects from **CORDIS** for 2015–2025 with **topic/keyword filters** from Phase X; (2) scrape **national call pages** for AI/HPC/EMC/GNSS/NDT topics and record call titles, dates, and links. These two moves typically surface the funder mix, emergent subdomains, and the cross‑border network structure.

---

## G) Sanctions/Legal Overlay (signals‑only; **non‑US persons**)
If any consortium partner or funding intermediary appears on EU/UK/CA/AU/NZ/UN lists, record as **signals** in `sanctions_hits.csv` with a source link and date; do **not** include US persons. Treat as **signals only**—not determinations.

---

## 3–5 Bullet Executive Summary
- **Anchor funders:** FFG, FWF, aws domestically; CORDIS/Horizon & EuroHPC at EU level.
- **Instruments matter:** Thematic calls, basic research grants, SME/innovation finance, and EU consortia drive collaboration edges and build facilities.
- **Fast evidence wins:** CORDIS export of **AT participants** + national call scrape for AI/HPC/EMC/GNSS/NDT terms.
- **MCF label‑independent:** Track functions (timing/RF/EMC/GNSS testbeds) rather than labels; triangulate with standards roles and accredited scopes.

## Next Data Boost (1 step)
Run a **CORDIS pull** for 2015–2025 (AT participants; Cluster 4/5 topics + Phase‑X keywords) and generate `programs.csv` + `grant_partners.tsv`; then refresh the report and update the **Funding Signals** table.
