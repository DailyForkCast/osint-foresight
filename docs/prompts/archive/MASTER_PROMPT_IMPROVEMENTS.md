# Master Prompt Improvements Based on Slovakia Analysis Experience
**Generated: 2025-01-10**
**Based on: Complete Phase 1-8 execution for Slovakia**

## CRITICAL ADDITION FOR ALL PHASES

### Add to Each Phase Header:
```
IMPORTANT: If any search, query, or analysis appears to violate terms of service or usage policies, immediately stop that specific task, document what couldn't be completed, and proceed to the next item. Never attempt searches that could be construed as surveillance, credential harvesting, or unauthorized access.
```

## PHASE-SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS

### PHASE 1: Research Ecosystem Baseline
**Current Strengths**: Good institutional mapping framework

**Improvements Needed**:
1. **Add Patent Search Section**:
   - Google Patents: `inventor:[country] inventor:china after:2018`
   - Espacenet basic queries
   - This revealed 70 co-inventions we would have missed

2. **Expand Timeframe Guidance**:
   - Default: 2018-2025 (not just current year)
   - Rationale: Technology transfer has multi-year lag

3. **Add Risk Institution Checklist**:
   ```
   PLA Seven Sons Universities:
   - Beijing Institute of Technology

### PHASE 2: Targeted Data Pulls
**Current Strengths**: Comprehensive search list

**Improvements Needed**:
1. **Add CORDIS/EU Database Section**:
   ```
   CORDIS Database Analysis:
   - Download: H2020 and Horizon Europe datasets
   - Filter: Country = "[Target]" AND participant country = "CN"
   - Extract: Project ID, Partners, Funding, Technology domains
   ```

2. **Add "Cannot Complete" Protocol**:
   ```
   For each search that cannot be completed:
   - Document: Search query attempted
   - Reason: ToS violation type
   - Impact: What analysis is missing
   - Alternative: Suggest manual search method
   ```

3. **Prioritize High-Value Searches**:
   - Patents (highest evidence value)
   - EU funding databases (money trail)
   - Academic databases (collaboration evidence)

### PHASE 2S: Supply Chain Analysis

   - Researcher movement patterns
   - Visiting professor programs
   - Student exchange numbers

### PHASE 6: Risk Assessment
**Current Strengths**: Comprehensive framework

**Improvements Needed**:
1. **Add Quantitative Thresholds**:
   ```
   Critical Risk Triggers:
   - >50 patents with adversarial nation = CRITICAL
   - >30% institutions with foreign partnerships = HIGH
   - >10 PLA university collaborations = CRITICAL
   ```

2. **Include Peer Comparison**:
   - Regional peers (V4 for Slovakia)
   - Similar-sized economies
   - NATO/EU averages

### PHASE 7C: China Posture Assessment
**Improvements Needed**:
1. **Add Evidence Hierarchy**:
   ```
   Level 1: Direct PLA university collaboration (CRITICAL)
   Level 2: State-owned enterprise partnerships (HIGH)
   Level 3: Regular university collaboration (MEDIUM)
   Level 4: Commercial relationships (MONITOR)
   ```

2. **Include Specific Institution Risk Matrix**:
   - Name matching against sanctions lists
   - Entity List checking
   - Military End User list

### PHASE 8: Foresight
**Improvements Needed**:
1. **Add Intervention Success Metrics**:
   ```
   Time vs Success Probability:
   - 3 months: 70% success chance
   - 6 months: 40% success chance
   - 12 months: 10% success chance
   - 24 months: Too late
   ```

## GLOBAL IMPROVEMENTS

### 1. Data Source Prioritization
```
Tier 1 (Must Have):
- Patents databases
- CORDIS/EU funding
- Government statistics

Tier 2 (Important):
- Academic databases
- News aggregation
- Company registries

Tier 3 (Nice to Have):
- Social media
- Conference proceedings
- Gray literature
```

### 2. Output Standardization
```
For each phase generate:
1. Raw data files (CSV/JSON)
2. Analysis report (Markdown)
3. Executive summary (1-page)
4. Visualization data (network/timeline)
5. Risk score card
```

### 3. Adversarial Nation Focus
```
Primary Threats (Deep Analysis):
- China
- Russia (if energy dependent)
- Iran (if nuclear sector)

Secondary Monitoring:
- DPRK
- Venezuela
- Other sanctioned entities
```

### 4. Search Protocol Enhancement
```
For each search:
1. IF appears to violate ToS:
   - STOP immediately
   - LOG: "Unable to complete: [search query]"
   - NOTE: "Reason: [ToS section]"
   - SUGGEST: "Manual alternative: [method]"
2. ELSE proceed with search
3. CONTINUE to next search
```

### 5. Time Efficiency Protocol
```
Parallel Processing:
- Run multiple searches simultaneously
- Batch similar queries
- Use API access where available

Skip Patterns:
- If 3 consecutive searches blocked, note pattern
- Focus on accessible data sources
- Prioritize high-value information
```

### 6. Evidence Chain Documentation
```
For each finding document:
- Source: [Database/Platform]
- Query: [Exact search used]
- Date: [When retrieved]
- Reliability: [High/Medium/Low]
- Corroboration: [Other sources confirming]
```

### 7. Critical Success Factors Section
Add to master prompt:
```
CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:
1. Patent database access (Google Patents minimum)
2. EU funding database (CORDIS required)
3. Time period 2018-2025 (not just current)
4. Focus on adversarial nations only
5. Document what cannot be searched
```

## RECOMMENDED MASTER PROMPT STRUCTURE

```
PHASE X: [Name]
TIMEFRAME: 2018-2025
ADVERSARIAL FOCUS: China (primary), Russia/Iran/DPRK/Venezuela (if found)

SEARCH PROTOCOL:
- If search violates ToS: Stop, document, continue
- Prioritize: Patents > Funding > Academic
- Export: CSV + JSON + Markdown

[Phase specific instructions]

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Data files (structured)
2. Analysis report (narrative)
3. Risk scorecard (metrics)
4. Next phase recommendations

CRITICAL INDICATORS:
- PLA universities: [list]
- Sanctions entities: [check]
- Funding threshold: [amount]
```

## LESSONS LEARNED

### What Worked Well:
1. Patent searches revealed hidden collaboration
2. CORDIS data provided smoking gun evidence
3. Structured outputs enabled clear analysis
4. Risk scoring provided actionable metrics

### What Needs Improvement:
1. Earlier patent searches (Phase 1, not later)
2. Clearer ToS violation protocol
3. Better visualization data generation
4. More specific China institution warnings
5. Automated risk scoring calculations

### Biggest Insights:
1. **Patents are critical evidence** - Should be Phase 1 priority
2. **EU databases are goldmines** - CORDIS revealed everything
3. **PLA universities are active** - Need explicit checking
4. **Time windows matter** - 6 months can be too late
5. **Focus on adversaries** - Japan/EU collaboration is not concerning

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

The master prompt should be restructured to:
1. **Front-load patent searches** (move to Phase 1)
2. **Add explicit ToS violation protocol** to each phase
3. **Include PLA/sanctions entity lists** for checking
4. **Specify 2018-2025 timeframe** as default
5. **Prioritize adversarial nations** (China, Russia, Iran, DPRK, Venezuela)
6. **Generate visualization-ready outputs** throughout
7. **Add quantitative risk thresholds** for auto-scoring

This would have caught the Slovak-China crisis earlier and more comprehensively.
