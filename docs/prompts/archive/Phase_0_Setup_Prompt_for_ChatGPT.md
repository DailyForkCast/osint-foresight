Research & write Phase 0 — Setup for <COUNTRY NAME> (<ISO2>).

Scope & rules
- Years: 2015–2025. Looser matchers ON.
- You MUST browse authoritative sources and CITE them (web.run).
- Target audience: solo analyst, zero budget. Degrade gracefully if items are thin.

What to find (authoritative portals & anchors)
- Government & Regulators: central govt, economy/industry ministry, science/innovation ministry, telecom/media regulator, national CERT.
- Funding & Programs: national R&I agency, innovation/SME bank, public procurement portal.
- Standards & Accreditation: national accreditation body (ISO/IEC 17025/17020 etc.), national SDO site/committees page.
- Research, Statistics, IP: national statistics office, national patent office; top universities’ research/lab directories.
- Trade, Logistics, Registries: customs/dual-use guidance, national company register, national open-data portal.
- EU/International (stable): CORDIS, EU Funding & Tenders, Eurostat, GLEIF, IETF Datatracker, OpenSanctions, UNCTAD.

Deliverables (inside the report)
- “References & Portals (seed list)” section with short purpose notes for each portal.
- A 6–8-item **watchlist YAML** snippet (cadence + URL) the analyst can paste into `queries/policy/watchlist.yaml`.
- One “Next Data Boost” (single, practical action).

Output contract
- Create a new canvas titled EXACTLY:
  "Write <COUNTRY NAME> Phase 0 — Setup (reports/country=<ISO2>/phase-0_setup.md)"
- The canvas must contain ONLY the final Markdown with front-matter (title, author, date).
- Include all web citations inline for non-obvious facts/links.
- If any expected portal is missing, add it as a placeholder with “(to verify)” and still render.
