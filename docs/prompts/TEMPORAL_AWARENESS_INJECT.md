# TEMPORAL AWARENESS REQUIREMENTS - INJECT INTO ALL PHASES

## ‚è∞ CRITICAL: TIME-AWARE ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS ‚è∞

**THIS MUST BE INJECTED AT THE START AND END OF EVERY PHASE PROMPT**

---

### üî¥ MANDATORY DATE CHECKS FOR ALL PHASES

```markdown
================== START OF ANALYSIS CHECK ==================
‚è∞ TEMPORAL AWARENESS CHECK #1 ‚è∞

CURRENT DATE: September 13, 2025 (Q3 2025)
- We are 75% through 2025
- 109 days remaining in 2025
- FY2025 is nearly complete, FY2026 budgets are SET
- Next influenceable budget: FY2027

CRITICAL RULES:
1. ‚ùå CANNOT recommend actions for 2024 or early 2025 (already past)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è MINIMUM 8-12 month delay for ANY new initiative
3. üìÖ "Immediate" = starts Q4 2025, results Q2 2026 minimum
4. üí∞ Budget impacts begin FY2027 at earliest
5. üèóÔ∏è Major programs need 18-24 months minimum

CHECK: Have you verified all dates are ‚â• September 2025?
=============================================================
```

### üìã PHASE-SPECIFIC TEMPORAL CHECKS

#### Phase 0-1: Setup & Indicators
```markdown
DATA CURRENCY CHECK:
- Latest complete data: Likely Q2 2025 or earlier
- Current quarter (Q3 2025): Incomplete data
- Projections must account for 3-6 month data lag
- Historical context: 2019-2024 data is complete
- Forward planning: 2026-2030 horizon
```

#### Phase 2-3: Landscape & Supply Chain
```markdown
POLICY/PROCUREMENT TIMELINE:
- Enacted policies (2019-2024): Historical baseline
- Current policies (2025): May still be implementing
- New policies: 12-18 month legislative cycle
- Procurement cycles: 9-15 months minimum
- Contract modifications: 3-6 months
- Full deployment: 18-24 months typical
```

#### Phase 4-7: Institutions, Funding, Links
```markdown
INSTITUTIONAL TIMELINE:
- Current academic year: 2025-2026
- Next funding cycle: 2026-2027
- Grant applications: 6-12 month lead time
- Collaboration agreements: 3-6 months to establish

- Cannot change current year allocations
```

#### Phase 8-9: Risk & Posture
```markdown
RISK HORIZON CALIBRATION:

```

### ‚ùå EXAMPLES OF TEMPORAL ERRORS TO AVOID

#### WRONG: Past-Tense Targets
```
‚ùå "Achieve 50% compliance by 2025"
‚ùå "Implement new systems in Q1 2025"
‚ùå "Secure FY2025 budget increase"
```

#### RIGHT: Future-Oriented Targets
```
‚úÖ "Achieve 50% compliance by Q3 2026"
‚úÖ "Implement new systems in Q3 2026"
‚úÖ "Secure FY2027 budget increase"
```

#### WRONG: Unrealistic Immediate Actions
```
‚ùå "Immediately deploy new capability"
‚ùå "Complete procurement this quarter"
‚ùå "Pass legislation this month"
```

#### RIGHT: Realistic Timelines
```
‚úÖ "Begin capability development Q4 2025, deploy Q3 2027"
‚úÖ "Initiate procurement Q4 2025, award Q3 2026"
‚úÖ "Draft legislation Q4 2025, passage expected Q2 2026"
```

### üìä REALISTIC TIMELINE TEMPLATES

‚Ä¢ Q4 2026: Testing and adjustment
‚Ä¢ Q1 2027: Scaled implementation
‚Ä¢ Q2 2027: Full operational capability

### ‚úÖ FINAL VALIDATION BEFORE OUTPUT

```markdown
================== END OF ANALYSIS CHECK ====================
‚è∞ TEMPORAL VALIDATION CHECKLIST ‚è∞

Before submitting your analysis, verify:

‚ñ° No recommendations for dates before September 2025
‚ñ° All "immediate" actions start Q4 2025 or later
‚ñ° Results expected no earlier than Q2 2026
‚ñ° Budget impacts target FY2027 or later
‚ñ° Major procurements complete 2027-2028
‚ñ° Transformation goals set for 2030+

SPECIFIC CHECKS:
‚ñ° Did you remove all references to "achieving X in 2024"?
‚ñ° Did you adjust "by 2025" targets to "by 2026" or later?
‚ñ° Did you account for 8-12 month implementation delays?
‚ñ° Did you align with realistic budget cycles?
‚ñ° Did you consider legislative/procurement timelines?

If ANY check fails, REVISE before submitting!
=============================================================
```

### üí° QUICK REFERENCE: TEMPORAL ADJUSTMENTS

| Original (Wrong) | Adjusted (Correct) | Reason |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------|
| "By end of 2025" | "By Q3 2026" | 8-12 month implementation |
| "FY2025 budget" | "FY2027 budget" | FY2026 already set |
| "Immediate deployment" | "Deploy Q3 2026" | Procurement cycle |
| "2024-2025 goals" | "2026-2027 goals" | Can't change past |
| "This quarter" | "Q2 2026" | Realistic planning |

### üìù STANDARD CAVEAT TO INCLUDE

```markdown
*Note: All timelines assume current date of September 13, 2025,
with minimum 8-12 month implementation delays for new initiatives.
Budget impacts begin FY2027. Major capability improvements
require 18-24 month development cycles.*
```

### üö® AUTOMATIC REJECTION TRIGGERS

Your analysis will be REJECTED if it contains:
1. Recommendations for actions in 2024
2. Targets for "end of 2025" (only 3.5 months left!)
3. FY2025 or FY2026 budget changes
4. "Immediate" results without 8-month delay
5. Procurement completion before 2026
6. Legislative passage in less than 6 months

## IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

### For ChatGPT:
1. Include START CHECK at beginning of every phase
2. Include END CHECK before generating output
3. Apply timeline adjustments automatically
4. Add temporal caveat to all recommendations

### For Claude Code:
1. Run temporal_validator.py on all outputs
2. Flag any past-tense recommendations
3. Auto-adjust unrealistic timelines
4. Validate budget cycle alignment

### For Manual Review:
1. Check every date against current date
2. Verify all timelines include delays
3. Ensure budget cycles are correct
4. Confirm no magical thinking about speed

**REMEMBER: Credibility requires realistic timelines. No one can change the past or compress physics!**
