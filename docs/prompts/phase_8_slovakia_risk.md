# Phase X – Slovakia (Phase 6)

**Goal:** Operationalize Phases 4–5 into an implementation tracker and monitoring system. ChatGPT‑only content.

---

## 1) Governance & cadence

- **Steering:** Battery JV Oversight Board (Economy, NBU, Defence, Foreign Affairs, MIRRI).  
- **Working groups:** (a) Export Controls, (b) NIS2/Supply‑Chain Software, (c) Secure Science & IP, (d) FDI/Screening.  
- **Cadence:** Steering (quarterly); WGs (monthly); ad‑hoc risk reviews (as triggered by EWIs).

## 3) RACI matrix (sample)

| Task | R | A | C | I |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Supplier inventory (GIB) | GIB COO | Min. Economy | NBU, Defence | OEMs, MIRRI |
| Code escrow (BMS) | GIB CTO | Oversight Board | Legal, Foreign Affairs | MIRRI |
| E10 export playbook | InoBat Compliance | Foreign Affairs | Defence, NBU | OEM/UAS partners |
| SBOM pilot | NBU | CIO Council | ESET, critical operators | MIRRI |
| MoU transparency at HEIs | University Rectors | MESRS | MIRRI, CVTI | Labs/PIs |

## 4) Monitoring dashboard (KPIs)

**Batteries/JV**  
- % tier‑2/3 suppliers disclosed; # of PRC‑origin vendors; # maintenance access events with audit logs.  
**Export controls**  
- # products with completed classification; avg. licence cycle time; # denied/queried licences.  
**NIS2/software**  
- # vendors with SBOM; # critical vulns remediated <30d; incident trend in covered sectors.  
**Secure science**  
- # MoUs published with full terms; % projects with third‑country dependency statements.

---

## 5) Early‑Warning Indicators (live triggers)

- **Ownership filings** or SPVs involving GIB/InoBat or key suppliers.  
- **New MoUs** with CN institutions (AI/batteries/microelectronics).  
- **Patent co‑assignments** with CN entities in target domains.  
- **Procurement awards** to thin‑track‑record cyber/AI vendors in critical sectors.  
- **NIS2 incidents** or advisories impacting Slovak covered entities.

**Trigger response SOP:** triage ≤48h → assign WG → update tracker → Steering review if High/Elevated.

## 6) Issues & change log

| # | Date | Issue/Change | Impact | Decision | Next step |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | — | — | — | — | — |

---

## 7) Reporting artifacts

- **Quarterly memo:** progress vs milestones; KPI charts; risk re‑scoring.  
- **Board pack:** supplier map (batteries), export‑control dashboard, NIS2 SBOM status, MoU transparency stats.  
- **One‑pagers:** per entity/cluster with ORS, mitigations, and open actions.

## 8) Handoff to Phase 7

- Freeze current tracker; compile final report with executive summary, findings, evidence tables, and citations log keyed to EV‑SK/EV‑COL IDs.
