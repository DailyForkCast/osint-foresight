# Phase X – Slovakia (Phase 7C — Communications & Messaging)

**Goal:** Provide a ready‑to‑use communications pack (messages, Q&A, talking points) aligned to Phases 4–5 risk posture. ChatGPT‑only content.

---

## 1) Message house (core narrative)

**Topline:** Slovakia welcomes high‑tech investment while safeguarding research integrity, security, and sovereign control over critical technology.  
**Proof points:** JV oversight, export‑control playbooks, NIS2/SBOM rollout, secure science standards.  
**Actions:** Supplier transparency, code escrow, MoU transparency, allied alignment on dual‑use exports.

---

## 2) Stakeholder talking points (one‑liners)

- **Government (Economy/Defence/NBU):** “Transparent supply chains and secure software are prerequisites for incentives.”
- **Industry (InoBat/GIB):** “Sovereign control of BMS and audited supplier lists are part of our licence to operate.”
- **Cyber (ESET & integrators):** “We minimize telemetry, publish SBOMs, and meet NIS2 with independent audits.”
- **Universities (SAS/STU/TUKE/CU):** “Open collaboration, clear rules: publish MoUs, guard IP, disclose third‑country dependencies.”
- **EU partners:** “Slovakia is a testbed for secure battery and AI supply chains.”

## 3) Press Q&A (anticipated)

**Q1: Is PRC capital controlling Slovakia’s battery future?**  
**A:** Investment does not equal control. Slovakia requires supplier transparency, code escrow for BMS, and change‑of‑control protections under an Oversight Board.

**Q2: Are UAV batteries being exported to risky end‑users?**  
**A:** Exports follow EU dual‑use rules with end‑use screening and a NATO‑preferred customer list; orders to red‑flag jurisdictions are blocked.

**Q3: Will NIS2 raise costs for Slovak firms?**  
**A:** Compliance reduces breach and downtime costs. Government support includes an SBOM pilot and a practical Compliance Playbook.

**Q4: Are universities restricting collaboration with China?**  
**A:** No blanket bans. We require transparency (publish MoUs, funding sources) and IP safeguards to keep cooperation high‑integrity.

## 4) Sound bites & stats (drop‑ins)

- “20 GWh battery capacity with sovereign BMS control.”
- “Export playbooks for UAV cells and EO systems — compliance at the speed of innovation.”
- “SBOM as standard in covered sectors by 12–18 months.”

---

## 5) Crisis comms (playbook shells)

- **Trigger:** media report of undisclosed PRC supplier → **Action:** disclose supplier list segment; confirm audit; announce mitigation (alternate vendor/controls).  
- **Trigger:** alleged problematic UAV export → **Action:** present end‑use files; confirm licensing; suspend shipment pending review; notify allies.  
- **Trigger:** NIS2 incident spike → **Action:** publish incident stats; accelerate patch SLAs; deploy red‑team.
