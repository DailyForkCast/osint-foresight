# Phase X – Slovakia (Phase 7)

**Goal:** Produce the final deliverables package: executive summary, findings, evidence table, and citations log — aligned to EV‑SK and EV‑COL IDs from Phases 2–3. ChatGPT‑only content (links/URLs to be attached separately if needed).

---

## 1) Executive summary (country snapshot)

- **Strategic picture:** Slovakia is an EU “Emerging Innovator” with rising capacity but talent gaps. Dual‑use hotspots: **battery JV (GIB)** with PRC‑linked parent; **UAV battery line (InoBat E10)**; **AI/cyber ecosystem (ESET)**; and participation in **IPCEI ME/CT**.  
- **Risk headline:** High exposure at the battery JV and Elevated exposure for UAV batteries; Medium exposures in AI/cyber and microelectronics; defence electronics exports require robust end‑use controls.  
- **Action headline:** Hard governance for the JV (supplier transparency, code escrow); export‑control playbooks; NIS2‑aligned SBOM & telemetry minimization; secure science policies for HEIs.

---

## 2) Findings (synthesized)

1. **Battery JV embeds PRC capital/tech** into a strategic Slovak supply chain with 20 GWh scale and state‑aid support. Downstream licensing shows outward tech diffusion.  
2. **InoBat’s UAV cell** positions Slovakia at the defence energy edge; export‑control pathways must be pre‑cleared.  
3. **AI/Cyber anchor (ESET)** and local labs form a credible capability stack; telemetry/model governance is the integrity hinge under NIS2.  
4. **Microelectronics/IPCEI** provides EU‑level support but demands stringent partner vetting and third‑country dependency disclosure.  
5. **Defence electronics exporters (EVPÚ et al.)** have broad reach; end‑use screening and sanctions checks are essential.  
6. **Ownership changes** (Timken→SPINEA; Zebra→Photoneo) reshape supply‑chain control and data/tech transfer pathways.

## 3) Evidence table (condensed)

| Evidence ID | Domain/Relation | Claim (short) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| EV‑SK‑0001/0002 | Batteries/JV | €1.2bn GIB plant; 20 GWh; production 2027; subsidies/tax relief | State‑aid & JV governance |
| EV‑SK‑0003/0012/0037 | Batteries/Defense | InoBat launches E10 UAV cell; EU‑made; prod. from 2025 | Export classification needed |
| EV‑SK‑0038/0039 | Batteries/Finance | InoBat €100m raise; company confirmation of JV agreement | Financing runway |
| EV‑SK‑0010/0011/0023/0024 | Microelectronics/IPCEI | SK included in ME/CT IPCEI; national roadmap & report | Identify beneficiaries |
| EV‑SK‑0020/0033/0034 | Cyber/AI | ESET campus & ecosystem expansion | NIS2 obligations |
| EV‑COL‑0004/0005 | M&A | Zebra–Photoneo; Timken–SPINEA | Ownership/control shift |
| EV‑SK‑0019/0036; EV‑COL‑0012 | Defence electronics | EVPÚ EO/test exports to 40+ countries | End‑use/sanctions screening |

## 4) Citations log (key sources by cluster)

> This log maps the most load‑bearing items; see Phase 2–3 canvases for full evidence IDs.

- **Batteries/JV:** Reuters coverage of the €1.2bn GIB plant (capacity, 2027 start, subsidies); InoBat newsroom confirmation.  
- **UAV battery:** Reuters and firm PR on InoBat E10 (fast charge, defence use).  
- **Digital Decade/IPCEI:** DG CONNECT country report; national strategic roadmap; Commission approval for ME/CT.  
- **AI/Robotics M&A:** Corporate releases on Zebra–Photoneo (agreement/close); Timken–SPINEA acquisition.  
- **Cyber/NIS2:** NBU’s NIS2 portal; Act 366/2024 references; practitioner guides.  
- **Soft‑power:** Comenius University Confucius Institute programming notice.

## 5) Policy & engagement plan (from Phase 5, distilled)

- **JV guardrails:** supplier disclosure, code escrow, change‑of‑control vetoes; EU FDI alignment.  
- **Export‑control playbooks:** E10 UAV batteries; EO/test equipment; NATO‑preferred customer list.  
- **NIS2 convergence:** SBOM pilot → sector rollout; telemetry minimization and access transparency.  
- **Secure science:** MoU transparency; visiting‑scholar due diligence; third‑country dependency statements.

## 6) Handover checklist

- [ ] Phase 6 tracker live (owners/dates).  
- [ ] Evidence pack with links (EV‑SK/EV‑COL).  
- [ ] Risk heatmap (per entity/cluster).  
- [ ] Briefing deck for Go‑Live meeting (gov + anchor firms + HEIs).  
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard wireframes (KPIs + EWIs).

---

## 7) Next steps

- Approve the **Engagement plan** (Section 5).  
- Schedule the **Go‑Live briefing** (Phase 6 → operational launch).  
- Confirm any additional deep‑dive pulls (e.g., procurement IDs, patent families).
