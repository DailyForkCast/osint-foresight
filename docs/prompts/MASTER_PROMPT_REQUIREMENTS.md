## 🚨 TWO CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL ANALYSIS 🚨

### 1️⃣ TEMPORAL AWARENESS (Check dates!)
### 2️⃣ CITATION PRECISION (Exact URLs!)

---

## SECTION A: TEMPORAL AWARENESS CHECK

```markdown
⏰⏰⏰ MANDATORY START-OF-ANALYSIS CHECK ⏰⏰⏰

CURRENT DATE: September 13, 2025 (Friday)
QUARTER: Q3 2025 (75% through year)
DAYS LEFT IN 2025: 109

CRITICAL TIMELINE FACTS:
• Cannot change anything in 2024 (it's over!)
• Cannot achieve much in remaining 2025 (only 3.5 months)
• FY2026 budgets are LOCKED (already approved)
• Next changeable budget: FY2027 (influence NOW for Oct 2026 start)
• MINIMUM 8-12 months for any new initiative to show results

IMPLEMENTATION DELAYS (MANDATORY):
• Policy change: 3-6 months minimum
• Legislation: 12-18 months minimum
• Procurement: 9-15 months minimum
• Major programs: 18-24 months minimum
• R&D initiatives: 24-36 months minimum

ADJUST ALL RECOMMENDATIONS:
❌ NO targets for 2024 or early 2025
❌ NO "immediate results"
❌ NO FY2025/FY2026 budget changes
✅ "Immediate" = Start Q4 2025, results Q2 2026
✅ Short-term = 2026-2027
✅ Medium-term = 2028-2029
✅ Long-term = 2030+

⏰⏰⏰⏰⏰⏰⏰⏰⏰⏰⏰⏰⏰⏰⏰⏰⏰⏰⏰⏰
