## 3) Post‑implementation review (PIR)

- **Timing:** T+90 days after Go‑Live.  
- **Inputs:** KPI dashboard (Phase 6), issues log, export‑licence stats, supplier changes.

## 4) Sustainment & ownership

- **Owners:** Oversight Board chairs (Economy/NBU).  
- **Cadence:** Quarterly board; monthly WG; EWI‑triggered reviews.  
- **Artifacts:** Updated tracker, KPI charts, risk re‑score, comms updates.

## 5) Closeout criteria

- **Policy instruments enacted** (FDI/JV guardrails, export playbooks, NIS2/SBOM guidance).  
- **Supply‑chain transparency** (≥80% tier‑2/3 disclosure; red‑flag matrix live).  
- **University standards** (MoU transparency; research security officer pilots).  
- **KPIs trending positive** (licence cycle time ↓, incidents ↓, SBOM coverage ↑).  
- **Handover accepted** by all owners.
