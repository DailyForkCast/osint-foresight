## Scope & Inputs
- **Country / ISO2:** Austria (AT) · **Years:** 2015–2025 · **Languages:** en, de · **Looser matchers:** ON
- **Primary files (if present):** `data/processed/country=AT/relationships.csv`, `standards_roles.tsv`, `institutions.csv`, `AccreditedLabs.tsv`, `capability_heat.tsv`, `programs.csv`, `international_links.tsv`, `prc_screen.tsv`, `sanctions_hits.csv`, optional `mechanism_incidents.tsv`.
- **Guardrails:** Neutral tone; *signals ≠ proof*. **Exclude US persons entirely** from sanctions/legal references. **MCF detection is label‑independent**: assess **functions** (timing/GNSS, RF/EMC, HPC access, JV/control) even if not labeled MCF.

## B) Scoring Rubric (transparent, simple)
- **Severity (1–3):** potential impact if exploited (1 low, 3 high).
- **Likelihood (L/M/H):** probability given current evidence.
- **Confidence (L/M/H):** evidence quality/quantity and recency.

> Use **multiple anchors** to lift confidence (e.g., accreditation scope **+** standards role **+** program link). If asserting MCF‑consistent risk, cite an **annex/ECCN hook** or mark **“unclear.”**

---

## C) Risk Register (by vector × cluster)

```text
# excel-tsv — data/processed/country=AT/risk_register.tsv
risk_id	vector_id	cluster_id	context	severity_1to3	likelihood_LMH	confidence_LMH	evidence_refs	notes
R1	RV2	C1	EuroHPC/VSC access enabling AI/ML scale	2	M	M	[VSCrunchy_2024, EuroHPC_node]	Routine EU governance; watch allocation shifts
R2	RV1	C3	IETF IPPM/NTP authorship recurring	2	L	M	[IPPM_role, NTP_role]	Influence signal; balanced by open process
R3	RV3	C6	EMC/RED labs expected; evidence pending	2	M	L	[Accreditation_scrape_todo]	Confirm scopes; inspect client base
R4	RV4	C4	Time/freq & GNSS calibration likely	2	L	L	[Accreditation_scrape_todo]	Look for GNSS simulators; disciplined oscillators
R5	RV6	C2	Ownership/control in key suppliers (TBD)	3	L	L	[LEI/OpenCorporates_todo]	Pull LEI; cross‑check parents
```

> **Populate** with concrete rows as evidence lands. Keep `context` short and non‑speculative.

---

## D) Best‑Practice Verification (controls present?)
Check for **process and policy mitigations** already in place; record as facts, not endorsements.

```text
# excel-tsv — data/processed/country=AT/control_evidence.tsv
control_id	control_name	where_observed	applies_to_vector	strength_0_3	evidence_refs	notes
C1	Export screening (EU)	University/Institute policy pages	RV2;RV3;RV4	1	[Uni_policy_URL]	Policy text only; need implementation proof
C2	InfoSec certifications (ISO 27001)	Cert body/registry	RV2;RV8	1	[27001_registry]	Signals cyber maturity in scope
C3	Conformity accreditation	National registry scopes	RV3;RV4;RV5	2	[Scope_PDF_hash]	Bench capability documented
```

> This table supports later mitigation planning (Phase 7/8) without prescribing actions now.

---

## E) Vignettes (1–5 short narratives)
Write ~120‑word vignettes for the **top 1–5** *prominent or concerning* risks (mix of vectors). If none rise above routine posture, state that explicitly.

```text
# excel-tsv — data/processed/country=AT/phase6_vignettes.tsv
rank	risk_id	vignette_120w	rationale	evidence_refs
1	R2	(120w on standards leverage vs open governance; why it matters; monitoring cues)	Standards influence is a soft‑power vector	[IPPM_role, NTP_role]
2	R1	(120w on compute allocation asymmetries and model dev)	Compute access can shape capability horizons	[VSCrunchy_2024, EuroHPC_node]
```

---

## F) Lay Narrative (what we see & why it matters)
Austria’s current risk posture is **moderate** and characterized by **capabilities in HPC** and **networking/timing** that enable downstream development, with **expected** but not yet fully documented **RF/EMC** and **time/frequency/GNSS** benches. The most credible near‑term vectors are: (1) **Compute access** shaping model and methods work; (2) **Standards participation** influencing test and deployment practice; and (3) emerging **conformity capabilities** (EMC/GNSS) that can bridge into sensitive systems.

Controls are present in principle (export screening, information‑security certifications, national accreditation), but their **operational strength** varies and needs verification beyond policy statements. As evidence accrues, the register will promote or demote risks by **severity, likelihood, and confidence**, with clear citation to the underlying documents, scopes, and rosters. **Sanctions/legal** mentions (EU/UK/CA/AU/NZ/UN) remain **signals‑only** and **exclude US persons**.

---

## G) Sanctions/Legal Overlay (signals‑only; **non‑US persons**)
If any party in the register appears on **EU/UK/CA/AU/NZ/UN** lists, add to `sanctions_hits.csv` with the source URL and date. Treat as **signals**—not determinations—and avoid US persons entirely.

---

## 3–5 Bullet Executive Summary
- **Most credible vectors:** Compute access (EuroHPC/VSC), standards leverage (IPPM/NTP), and likely RF/EMC & GNSS benches.
- **Evidence lifts:** Accreditation scopes, LEI/OpenCorporates joins, and concrete allocation/policy docs.
- **Controls exist on paper:** Export screening, 27001, and accreditation—verify operational strength.
- **Method:** Transparent scoring (severity, likelihood, confidence) with multi‑anchor evidence; label‑independent MCF cues.

---

## Next Data Boost (1 step)
Capture **10–20 accreditation scopes** in **EMC/RED** and **time/frequency/GNSS**, compute **scope_text_hash**, and link labs to clusters. Then refresh **risk_register.tsv** and **phase6_vignettes.tsv** accordingly.
