# Phase X – Slovakia (Phase 5)

**Goal:** Translate Phase 2–4 findings into concrete policy & engagement recommendations, a country‑tailored action plan, and a risk heatmap for decision‑makers. ChatGPT‑only deliverable.

---

## 1) Executive takeaways (one‑pager)

- **Top risks to mitigate (next 12–18 months):**
  1) **Battery JV (GIB: InoBat–Gotion)** — high exposure via PRC capital/tech; supplier chain leverage; downstream licensing diffusion.
  2) **InoBat UAV battery line (E10)** — dual‑use exports and end‑use controls require early gating.
  3) **AI/Cyber telemetry & software supply chain (ESET ecosystem)** — NIS2‑driven obligations; data residency & access transparency.
- **Opportunities to preserve:** EU funding (IPCEI/Horizon) for microelectronics and AI; anchor firms (ESET, Photoneo) as compliance exemplars; university consortia for secure science.

## 3) Policy recommendations (country‑level)

1) **FDI & JV Guardrails (Batteries).**
   - Require **change‑of‑control vetoes**, **board‑level security committee**, and **source‑code escrow** for BMS/EMS.
   - Mandate **supplier disclosure** down to sub‑supplier tier; pre‑approve **maintenance access** and remote‑service pathways.
   - Align with **EU FDI screening** and notify where cross‑border equipment vendors are PRC‑origin.

2) **Dual‑Use Export Readiness (UAV batteries & defence electronics).**
   - Create a **fast‑track classification cell** to map E10/UAV batteries and EO/test equipment to EU dual‑use categories; template **end‑use statements** and **customer KYC**.
   - Coordinate with allies for a **NATO‑preferred distribution** list; establish a **red‑flag jurisdiction** matrix.

3) **Secure Science & High‑Integrity Collaboration.**
   - Require **third‑country dependency statements** and **IP segregation** (background/foreground) for IPCEI/Horizon projects; introduce **audit‑ready data‑management plans**.
   - Encourage universities to adopt **visiting‑scholar due‑diligence** and **MoU transparency** (publish terms; funding sources; affiliation checks).

4) **NIS2 + Supply‑Chain Software Convergence.**
   - Issue guidance for **telemetry minimization**, **regional data residency**, and **SBOM** expectations for vendors to covered sectors.
   - Pilot an **assurance program** (attestations + red‑team exercises) for endpoint/EDR vendors and critical integrators.

5) **Market Shaping & Incentives.**
   - Tie **state‑aid tranches** to compliance milestones (supplier transparency, export‑control readiness, IP safeguards).
   - Offer **grants for compliance tooling** (SBOM, licence management, data‑loss prevention) to SMEs in AI/microelectronics.

## 4) Engagement plan (stakeholder‑specific)

### 4.1 Government (Economy, Foreign Affairs, Defence, MIRRI, NBU)
- **Message:** Maintain investment while hardening governance and compliance.
- **Actions:** Quarterly **Battery JV Oversight Board**; integrated **FDI + export + NIS2** review stream; publish a **Compliance Playbook** for dual‑use firms.

### 4.2 Anchor companies (InoBat/GIB, ESET, Photoneo, EVPÚ, SPINEA)
- **Message:** Compliance as competitive advantage; early clarity reduces friction.
- **Actions:** Co‑develop **export‑control playbooks** (E10, EO equipment); implement **data‑access transparency** dashboards; establish **supplier attestation** process.

### 4.3 Academia (SAS, STU, TUKE, CU, UNIZA, UPJŠ)
- **Message:** Secure collaboration keeps EU funding flowing and IP sovereign.
- **Actions:** Adopt **MoU transparency**; standardize **PI checklists** (affiliations, sanctions, data clauses); pilot **research security officers** at top faculties.

### 4.4 EU/Allied partners (DG GROW, DG CONNECT, like‑minded states)
- **Message:** Slovakia as a testbed for secure battery/AI pipelines.
- **Actions:** Share **supplier risk lists**; align **licensing norms** for UAV batteries; coordinate **IPCEI partner vetting**.
