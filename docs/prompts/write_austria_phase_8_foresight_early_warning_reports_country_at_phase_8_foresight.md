## Comprehensive Narrative

**How we built the scenarios.** We combined Phase 2/2S signals (e.g., VSC/Vienna Scientific Cluster upgrade; EuroHPC ties), Phase 5 links (ICLR 2024 Vienna, international research co‑authorships), and Phase 2 standards roles (IETF IPPM/NTP authorship) to set axes around compute access and standards posture. The 2‑year horizon stresses compute availability; the 5‑year considers standards‑led competitiveness; the 10‑year explores a low‑likelihood but high‑impact divergence via sensitive JV/equity vectors.

**Sector outlooks.** In **AI/ML**, capacity is paced by shared EuroHPC/VSC access; without additional domestic GPU clusters or guaranteed allocations, timelines for large‑scale model work may stretch. In **Comms/Timing**, a small number of named experts anchor standards leverage; succession planning protects continuity. **HPC** remains a lever and a dependency; cross‑border governance or outages could ripple into AI timelines. **Sensing/PNT** and **advanced manufacturing/materials** stay on the watchlist pending stronger evidence from labs/accreditations or standards deliverables.

**Signals‑to‑doctrine.** Austrian signals generally align with EU‑centric strategies prioritizing responsible AI, compute sharing, and standards participation. We find **no strong evidence** of active, concerning PRC MCF‑consistent vectors in Austria; given regional posture, we treat this as **low likelihood** but keep doctrine‑to‑signal mapping on watch (Phase 7C).

**Why this matters and how to falsify.** If queue times stabilize and alternates assume SDO roles, near‑term risks diminish; conversely, a credible sensitive JV/equity filing would raise long‑horizon concern. Each claim lists a concrete falsification path.

## 3–5 Bullet Executive Summary

- **Near‑term (2y):** Compute allocation is the pacing factor for AI model work; standards depth mitigates risk.
- **Medium‑term (5y):** With stable SDO roles and EuroHPC ties, Austria can be **standards‑competitive** in AI/comms even without frontier GPUs on‑prem.
- **Long‑term (10y):** Low‑likelihood but high‑impact risk from sensitive JV/equity vectors; maintain light registry/watchlist monitoring.
- **Actionable:** Diversify compute access; train SDO alternates; maintain doctrine alignment checks; monitor talent flow.
