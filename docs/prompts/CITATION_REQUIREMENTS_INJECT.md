### üìù PROMPT INJECTION TEMPLATE

```markdown
[Insert at the beginning of EVERY data collection prompt]

CRITICAL: ALL citations MUST include:

2. accessed_date in YYYY-MM-DD format
3. Document title (exact, not paraphrased)

Example:

Store accessed_date with EVERY source!
```

### üîÑ FOR AUTOMATED SYSTEMS

```python
# Validation function to include in all scrapers/collectors
def validate_citation(citation):
    errors = []

    # Check URL is specific
    if not citation.get('exact_url') or citation['exact_url'].endswith(('.com/', '.org/', '.gov/')):
        errors.append("URL must point to specific document, not homepage")

    # Check accessed_date exists
    if not citation.get('accessed_date'):
        errors.append("accessed_date is REQUIRED")

    # Validate date format
    if citation.get('accessed_date') and not re.match(r'^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$', citation['accessed_date']):
        errors.append("accessed_date must be YYYY-MM-DD format")

    return len(errors) == 0, errors
```

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

1. **For ChatGPT:** Include the citation requirements section at the TOP of every prompt
2. **For Claude Code:** Add validation checks to all data collection scripts
3. **For Manual Entry:** Use the validation checklist before saving
4. **For APIs:** Store accessed_date with every API response

## ENFORCEMENT

- Citations without exact URLs will be REJECTED
- Missing accessed_date will trigger validation ERROR
- Homepage-only links will be flagged for correction
- All phases must comply with these standards

**Remember:** The credibility of our analysis depends on traceable, verifiable sources. Every citation must point to the EXACT document we're referencing, and we must track WHEN we accessed it.
