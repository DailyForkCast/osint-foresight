## 📊 CLASSIFICATION RULES

### Geographic Registration - ALLOWED STATEMENTS:
- ✅ "Registered in [Country]"
- ✅ "Incorporated in [Jurisdiction]"
- ✅ "[X] companies found with Cayman Islands registration"
- ❌ "Shell companies in Cayman Islands"

### Operational Status - REQUIRES EVIDENCE:
To state "no operations" you MUST cite:
- Specific filing stating "we have no operations"
- Employee count = 0 from official filing
- No revenue reported in financial statements

### Purpose Classification - REQUIRES DOCUMENTATION:
- **Holding Company:** Must cite org structure from filing
- **SPAC:** Must cite "blank check company" from filing
- **VIE:** Must cite "Variable Interest Entity" from filing
- **Shell:** Must cite "no operations" + "no assets" from filing

## 🎯 WHY THIS MATTERS

### Intelligence Value:
- **FACT:** "41 companies registered in Cayman Islands" = VALUABLE
- **ASSUMPTION:** "41 shell companies" = MISLEADING AND HARMFUL

### Credibility:
- Every assumption undermines the real findings
- False drama makes real risks seem exaggerated
- Neutral facts are more powerful than speculation

## ✅ CORRECT EXAMPLES

### Finding Chinese Companies:
❌ **WRONG:** "Discovered network of shell companies hiding Chinese ownership"
✅ **RIGHT:** "Identified 41 companies registered in offshore jurisdictions, including 15 with Chinese operations per their 10-K filings"

### VIE Structures:
❌ **WRONG:** "Companies using deceptive VIE structures to circumvent law"
✅ **RIGHT:** "11 companies disclosed Variable Interest Entity structures in their 20-F filings"

### Risk Assessment:
❌ **WRONG:** "High risk due to suspicious Cayman registration"
✅ **RIGHT:** "Cayman Islands registration noted; jurisdiction has 0% corporate tax and is common for VIE structures"

## 📝 IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

Before stating ANY classification:
- [ ] Do I have a specific quote from a filing?
- [ ] Am I adding interpretation beyond the facts?
- [ ] Would this stand up to scrutiny?
- [ ] Is this what the data actually says?

## 🔴 RED FLAGS IN YOUR OWN ANALYSIS

If you write these words, STOP and verify:
- "Shell"
- "Suspicious"
- "Hiding"
- "Evading"
- "Circumventing"
- "Exposed"
- "Web"
- "Network" (unless demonstrably connected)

## 📊 VALUABLE WITHOUT ASSUMPTIONS

### What We CAN Say:
"Analysis of 10,123 SEC-registered companies identified 41 entities incorporated in offshore jurisdictions (39 Cayman Islands, 2 BVI). Of these, 15 report operations in China per their latest 20-F filings. Cayman Islands incorporation is utilized by 73% of Chinese companies listed on US exchanges due to VIE structure requirements under Chinese law."

This is **MORE VALUABLE** than speculation because it's:
- Verifiable
- Actionable
- Defensible
- Professional

**REMEMBER:** The facts are interesting enough. We don't need to embellish them. A company being registered in Cayman Islands is significant information without calling it a "shell."
