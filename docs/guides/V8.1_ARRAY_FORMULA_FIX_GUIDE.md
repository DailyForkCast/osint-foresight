# v8.1 - Array Formula Fix Guide
**File:** `2025-10-26-Tracker-v8.1.xlsx`
**Issue:** Deliverables, Audiences, and Technologies not showing in Project Spotlight
**Solution:** Enable array formulas with Ctrl+Shift+Enter

---

## 🎯 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

Open `2025-10-26-Tracker-v8.1.xlsx` and follow these steps:

---

## SECTION 1: KEY DELIVERABLES (10 cells)

**Location:** Project_Spotlight sheet, rows 18-27, column B

### **Steps:**
1. Click on cell **B18**
2. Look at the formula bar (top of Excel) - you'll see a long formula
3. Press **F2** (to edit the cell)
4. Press **Ctrl+Shift+Enter** (all three keys together)
5. The formula bar will show `{=IFERROR(INDEX...)}` with **{curly braces}**
6. If you see the braces, it worked! ✅

### **Repeat for these cells:**
```
B18 - 1st deliverable
B19 - 2nd deliverable
B20 - 3rd deliverable
B21 - 4th deliverable
B22 - 5th deliverable
B23 - 6th deliverable
B24 - 7th deliverable
B25 - 8th deliverable
B26 - 9th deliverable
B27 - 10th deliverable
```

**After fixing:** You should see:
- "Technical Requirements Doc" in B18
- "Beta Release" in B19
- Remaining cells blank (no more deliverables)

---

## SECTION 2: TARGET AUDIENCES (9 cells)

**Location:** Project_Spotlight sheet, rows 6-14, column G

### **Steps:**
1. Click on cell **G6**
2. Press **F2**
3. Press **Ctrl+Shift+Enter**
4. Check for {curly braces} in formula bar

### **Repeat for these cells:**
```
G6 - 1st audience
G7 - 2nd audience
G8 - 3rd audience
G9 - 4th audience
G10 - 5th audience
G11 - 6th audience
G12 - 7th audience
G13 - 8th audience
G14 - 9th audience
```

**Note:** These will show blank until you add audiences to Project_Audiences sheet

---

## SECTION 3: TARGET TECHNOLOGIES (9 cells)

**Location:** Project_Spotlight sheet, rows 6-14, column J

### **Steps:**
1. Click on cell **J6**
2. Press **F2**
3. Press **Ctrl+Shift+Enter**
4. Check for {curly braces} in formula bar

### **Repeat for these cells:**
```
J6 - 1st technology
J7 - 2nd technology
J8 - 3rd technology
J9 - 4th technology
J10 - 5th technology
J11 - 6th technology
J12 - 7th technology
J13 - 8th technology
J14 - 9th technology
```

**Note:** These will show blank until you add technologies to Project_Technologies sheet

---

## 📊 TOTAL CELLS TO FIX: 28

- 10 deliverable cells (B18-B27)
- 9 audience cells (G6-G14)
- 9 technology cells (J6-J14)

---

## ✅ HOW TO VERIFY IT WORKED

### **Test 1: Deliverables**
After fixing B18:
- Formula bar should show: `{=IFERROR(INDEX(T_Project_Deliverables...)}` (with braces)
- Cell B18 should display: **"Technical Requirements Doc"**
- Cell B19 should display: **"Beta Release"**

### **Test 2: Other Cells**
- Once formulas have {braces}, they're "array formulas" and will work
- Other columns (Due Date, Status, Owner) will auto-populate based on deliverable name

---

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES

### **Mistake 1: Typing the braces**
❌ DON'T type `{` and `}` manually
✅ Excel adds them automatically when you press Ctrl+Shift+Enter

### **Mistake 2: Pressing just Enter**
❌ Regular Enter won't make it an array formula
✅ Must press Ctrl+Shift+Enter

### **Mistake 3: Editing the formula**
❌ If you edit and press Enter, braces disappear
✅ Always finish edits with Ctrl+Shift+Enter

---

## 💡 SHORTCUTS TO SAVE TIME

### **Quick Method (if you're comfortable with Excel):**

1. **Select range B18:B27** (all 10 deliverable cells at once)
2. Press **F2** (edit mode)
3. Press **Ctrl+Shift+Enter**
4. All 10 cells get array formulas at once! ✨

**Repeat for:**
- G6:G14 (audiences)
- J6:J14 (technologies)

**Total time:** ~30 seconds instead of 5 minutes!

## 📝 WHAT IF EXCEL 365?

If you have **Excel 365** (Microsoft 365 subscription):
- Array formulas work automatically
- You DON'T need Ctrl+Shift+Enter
- Formulas should already be working
- Check: Do you see the deliverables? If yes, you're done!

---

## 🔍 STILL NOT WORKING?

### **Check 1: Is B2 set correctly?**
- Cell B2 should contain "PRJ-001"
- This is the selected project

### **Check 2: Do deliverables exist?**
- Go to **Project_Deliverables** sheet
- Should see 2 rows:
  - Row 2: PRJ-001 | Technical Requirements Doc
  - Row 3: PRJ-001 | Beta Release

### **Check 3: Is the table named correctly?**
- Go to **Project_Deliverables** sheet
- Click any cell in the data
- Look at **Table Design** tab (ribbon)
- Table Name should be: **T_Project_Deliverables**

---

## 📚 WHAT ARE ARRAY FORMULAS?

**Simple explanation:**
- Regular formula: Looks at one value, returns one value
- Array formula: Looks at multiple values, does calculations, returns one value
- Needs special entry: Ctrl+Shift+Enter to tell Excel "this is an array formula"

**Example in our tracker:**
```
Regular formula: =INDEX(Table[Column], 2)
  → Gets the value from row 2

Array formula: =INDEX(Table[Column], SMALL(IF(Table[ID]="PRJ-001", ROW(Table[ID])), 1))
  → Looks at ALL rows, finds ones matching PRJ-001, gets the 1st match
  → Needs Ctrl+Shift+Enter to work
```

## 🎉 DONE!

**Time required:** 2-5 minutes
**Difficulty:** Easy (once you do the first one, rest are identical)

**Pro tip:** Save the file after fixing. Excel will remember the array formulas!

## 📞 TROUBLESHOOTING

**Q: I pressed Ctrl+Shift+Enter but nothing happened**
A: Make sure you pressed F2 first to enter edit mode

**Q: The braces disappeared**
A: You probably edited the cell and pressed Enter. Press F2 again and Ctrl+Shift+Enter

**Q: Still showing blank**
A: Check that deliverables exist in Project_Deliverables sheet for PRJ-001

**Q: This is tedious, is there a better way?**
A: Yes! Use the "Quick Method" above - select all cells at once and do Ctrl+Shift+Enter once

**Good luck! Let me know if you get stuck.**
