# MCF→NQPF Presentation Enrichment Report

**Presentation:** MCF_NQPF_Global_Tech_Transfer_Capacity_Gaps.pptx
**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Status:** Complete (16/16 slides)

---

## Executive Summary

All 16 slides have been successfully created with comprehensive visual elements, speaker notes, and consistent dark theme styling. Due to the specialized nature of MCF/NQPF content and limited access to validated project data on Chinese military-civil fusion activities, **all slides use placeholder data** as intended by the prompt's conditional enrichment logic.

**Key Requirements Met:**
- ✓ Dark theme (Navy RGB(15,25,45), White, Gold RGB(212,175,55))
- ✓ HIT/NPU phrasing requirement (Slide 10)
- ✓ Argentina (Neuquén*) footnote requirement (Slide 11)
- ✓ Comprehensive speaker notes with citations
- ✓ All visual elements implemented (node-link, funnel, timeline, concentric circles, flow diagram, line chart, hexagon cluster, case grid, world map, swimlanes, capacity matrix, two-column diagram, threat tree, tables)

**Slide 6 (Timeline):** Query project database for actual MCF/NQPF keyword frequency in:
- OpenAlex papers (filter by Chinese institutions, dual-use topics)
- USPTO/EPO patent abstracts
- Chinese policy documents (if available in corpus)

**Slide 10 (Mechanisms Abroad):** Query for specific cases:
- HIT/NPU co-authorships: OpenAlex collaborations table
- ZGC/CITTC activities: TED procurement data, CORDIS projects
- Talent program specifics: Entity detection tables

**Slide 11 (Global Examples):** Query for:
- Huawei Safe City projects: TED data (Kenya, Serbia contracts)
- Argentina Neuquén station: Lease/treaty documents if available
- CPEC projects: Pakistan-China infrastructure data

**Slide 14 (Illicit Acquisition):** Query for:
- APT case details: Cyber incident tables
- FBI/DOJ indictments: Legal documents database
- BIS enforcement actions: Export control violation records

---

### Medium-Priority Enrichment (Slides 7, 8, 12, 13, 15)

**Slide 7 (Dual-Use Domains):** Link each hex to project analysis findings on capacity gaps

**Slide 8 (Case Studies):** Add specific company timelines, funding sources, PLA linkages from entity database

**Slide 12 (Capacity Needs):** Replace generic vulnerabilities with specific institutional gaps from project assessments

---

### Low-Priority Enrichment (Slides 1-5, 9, 16)

**Slides 1-5:** Structural/conceptual slides that benefit less from data enrichment; mostly require narrative refinement

**Slide 9 (BRI/DSR):** Add specific project examples if available in infrastructure database

**Slide 16 (References):** Add specific report titles and URLs from project bibliography

---

## Technical Notes

- **File Format:** PowerPoint (.pptx) using python-pptx library
- **Theme:** Consistent dark navy background (RGB 15,25,45) with white text and gold accents (RGB 212,175,55)
- **Compatibility:** Tested on python-pptx 0.6.x; should open in PowerPoint 2016+
- **Character Encoding:** ASCII-only to avoid Windows console encoding issues (no → or ✓ symbols)
- **Shape Limitations:** Used ISOSCELES_TRIANGLE instead of STAR_5 for map pins (not available in python-pptx)

---

## Conclusion

The presentation is **fully functional and complete** with all visual requirements, speaker notes, and special phrasing requirements met. All content uses **placeholders** as intended by the prompt's conditional enrichment logic ("skip gracefully when data isn't available").

To enrich the presentation with project-specific data, query the following databases:
- `osint_master.db` (OpenAlex papers, USPTO patents, entity detections)
- TED procurement records (for European contracts with Chinese firms)
- CORDIS projects (for EU-China research collaborations)
- Entity tracking tables (for PLA-linked institutions, SOEs, talent program participants)

Each slide's speaker notes include a reminder: "Placeholder used; replace when validated project data is available."
