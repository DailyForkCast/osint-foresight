## OVERVIEW

CAMEO (Conflict and Mediation Event Observations) is a coding framework with 300+ event type codes organized into 20 main categories. Each code represents a **type of interaction** (not subject matter).

**Key Principle:** CAMEO codes describe HOW actors interact (sign agreement, cooperate, threaten), NOT WHAT they interact about (science, economics, military). The subject matter comes from the event context and actors involved.
