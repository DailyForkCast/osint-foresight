# Zero Fabrication Protocol
## Critical Requirements for Data Integrity

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-01
**Status:** MANDATORY COMPLIANCE

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL INCIDENT LOG

### Incident 001: Web of Science Fabrication
**Date:** 2025-09-21
**Description:** Claimed "Web of Science has 15% geographic coverage" without any actual data
**Root Cause:** Used "general knowledge" instead of verified data
**Impact:** False information in strategic intelligence report
**Corrective Action:** Removed claim, updated all reports, strengthened protocols
**LESSON:** Even "reasonable estimates" based on "general knowledge" are FABRICATION if not based on actual data in our possession.

### Incident 002: Shell Company Assumptions
**Date:** 2025-09-21
**Description:** Labeled Cayman Islands-registered companies as "shell companies" without evidence
**Root Cause:** Added interpretation to geographic registration fact
**Impact:** Unprofessional analysis with unsubstantiated claims
**Corrective Action:** Changed to "offshore-registered companies," removed interpretive language
**LESSON:** Registration location is a fact; "shell company" is an assumption requiring specific evidence.

### Incident 003: GDELT Propaganda Campaign Fabrication
**Date:** 2025-11-01
**Description:** Claimed "Coordinated propaganda campaign detected" based solely on sentiment measurement difference (Chinese media +2.69, Western media -1.81)
**Root Cause:** Confirmation bias - inferred coordination and intent from sentiment divergence without documentary evidence
**Impact:** Multiple fabrications in GDELT strategic intelligence documents:
- "Coordinated propaganda campaign detected"
- "Coordinated messaging campaign active"
- "Influence operations detected"
- "Intimidation campaigns"
**Corrective Action:** Changed all instances to factual observations: "Sentiment divergence observed. Chinese state media: +2.69 average sentiment, Western media: -1.81 average sentiment. Divergence: 4.5 points. Cause unknown."
**LESSON:** Can only state measurements from data (sentiment scores), not interpretations of causation, intent, or coordination. Even "likely reflects" is too definitive without evidence. Cognitive bias (confirmation bias, pattern-seeking) leads to seeing campaigns/coordination that aren't evidenced in data.
n### Incident 004: Sensationalized Language in Lithuania Analysis
**Date:** 2025-11-02
**Description:** Used emotional, sensationalized language in GDELT analysis ("Crisis begins", "Peak crisis month", "Economic coercion")
**Root Cause:** Editorialized presentation instead of neutral factual reporting
**Impact:** Analysis appeared unprofessional, added interpretation beyond what data showed
**Corrective Action:** Revised to neutral language ("Event analysis", "Peak activity month", "Economic measures"), created Language and Tone Standards document
**LESSON:** Present data neutrally without editorializing. Let readers draw their own conclusions from factual presentation. Avoid dramatic language ("crisis erupts", "smoking gun", "devastating impact").

## Professional Intelligence Standards & References

This protocol aligns with established U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) analytic standards and tradecraft:

### 1. ODNI ICD 203: Analytic Standards (2015)

**Source:** Office of the Director of National Intelligence
**URL:** https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD-203.pdf

Intelligence Community Directive 203 codifies standards mandated by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRPTA). ICD 203 demands that all IC analysis be:

- **Objective** - Free from distortion by personal bias or institutional agenda
- **Independent of political consideration** - Analysis not shaped by policy preferences
- **Timely** - Responsive to customer needs
- **Based on all available sources** - Not selective use of convenient data
- **Properly described** - Clarity about sources, methods, and confidence levels

**Relevance to Zero Fabrication:** ICD 203's requirement that analysis be "based on all available sources" directly prohibits fabrication - we cannot cite sources we don't have. The directive's emphasis on objectivity prohibits adding interpretive labels without evidence.

### 2. CIA Tradecraft Primer: Structured Analytic Techniques (2009)

**Source:** CIA Center for the Study of Intelligence
**URL:** https://www.cia.gov/resources/csi/static/Tradecraft-Primer-apr09.pdf

The CIA's Tradecraft Primer addresses "the perennial problems of intelligence: the complexity of international developments, incomplete and ambiguous information, and the inherent limitations of the human mind."

**Key Techniques:**
- **Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH)** - Systematically evaluate alternative explanations
- **Devil's Advocacy** - Challenge prevailing assumptions
- **High-Impact/Low-Probability Analysis** - Consider unlikely but significant events
- **"What If?" Analysis** - Explore alternative scenarios

**Relevance to Zero Fabrication:** The Primer's structured techniques prevent cognitive biases that lead to fabrication. ACH requires evidence for all hypotheses, not assumptions. The emphasis on managing uncertainty aligns with our "acknowledge what we don't know" principle.

### 3. Sherman Kent: "Words of Estimative Probability" (1964)

**Source:** CIA Studies in Intelligence
**URL:** https://www.cia.gov/resources/csi/static/Words-of-Estimative-Probability.pdf

Sherman Kent's foundational work addressed the problem of misleading probability expressions in National Intelligence Estimates. In 1951, a CIA warning of a "serious possibility" of Soviet invasion was interpreted by different readers as anywhere from 20% to 80% probability.

**Kent's Framework:**
- Distinguished "poets" (qualitative language) from "mathematicians" (quantitative odds)
- Developed standardized probability terms to prevent misinterpretation
- Emphasized clarity: "make clear to the reader what is certain knowledge and what is reasoned judgment"

**Relevance to Zero Fabrication:** Kent's principle that we must distinguish "certain knowledge" from "reasoned judgment" is central to our protocol. We cannot use probability words ("likely," "possible," "probable") without data to support them. Our protocol goes further: we avoid estimative language entirely when we lack evidence.

### 4. Richards Heuer: "Psychology of Intelligence Analysis" (1999)

**Source:** CIA Center for the Study of Intelligence
**URL:** https://www.cia.gov/resources/csi/static/Pyschology-of-Intelligence-Analysis.pdf

Heuer's seminal work on cognitive biases in intelligence analysis identifies systematic errors in human judgment:

**Key Cognitive Biases:**
- **Confirmation bias** - Seeking data that confirms existing beliefs
- **Availability bias** - Overweighting easily recalled information
- **Anchoring** - Over-reliance on initial information
- **Mirror imaging** - Assuming others think like we do
- **Premature closure** - Accepting first satisfactory explanation

**Relevance to Zero Fabrication:** Our incidents demonstrate these biases:
- Web of Science fabrication: Availability bias (recalling "general knowledge")
- Shell company assumptions: Premature closure (accepting first explanation)
- GDELT propaganda claims: Confirmation bias (seeing patterns we expected)

Heuer's Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH) methodology requires evidence for all hypotheses equally - fabrication fails this test.

### 5. ODNI Estimative Language Standards

The Intelligence Community uses standardized probability language to prevent Kent's "serious possibility" problem:

**Standard Terms:**
- **Almost certainly** (>90% probability)
- **Likely/Probable** (>65%)
- **Even chance** (~50%)
- **Unlikely** (<35%)
- **Remote/Highly unlikely** (<10%)

**Our Adaptation:** We use these terms ONLY when we have data to support probability assessment. When we lack data, we state "unknown" rather than guess.

### 6. Applying IC Standards to OSINT Analysis

Professional intelligence standards apply equally to open-source intelligence:

| IC Standard | Zero Fabrication Application |
|------------|------------------------------|
| "Based on all available sources" | Cannot cite sources we don't have (e.g., Web of Science) |
| "Properly described sources" | Full provenance for all data (database, date, method) |
| "Distinguish facts from judgments" | Geographic registration (fact) vs "shell company" (judgment) |
| "Express uncertainty" | "Cannot determine without data" not "likely X%" |
| "Challenge assumptions" | ACH methodology prevents premature conclusions |
| "Identify cognitive biases" | Incident log tracks bias patterns |

### 7. Why Professional Standards Matter

**Credibility:** Intelligence products without rigorous standards are dismissed by policymakers.

**Legal defensibility:** Fabricated claims cannot withstand scrutiny in legal/regulatory contexts.

**Mission effectiveness:** Bad intelligence leads to bad decisions - fabrication undermines mission.

**Professional reputation:** OSINT analysis must meet same standards as classified intelligence.

### Key Principle from IC Tradecraft

**ICD 203, Section 3.B:** "Analytic products...must distinguish between underlying intelligence information, analysts' assumptions and judgments, and other entities' stated policies or intentions."

**Translation to Zero Fabrication:**
- **Underlying intelligence information** = Data we actually have
- **Analysts' assumptions** = Must be labeled as such (we prohibit unlabeled assumptions)
- **Analysts' judgments** = Must be based on evidence, not fabricated
- **Other entities' intentions** = Can only state if documented (e.g., policy papers)

---

## Core Principles

### 1. ABSOLUTE RULE: No Data Without Evidence
- **NEVER** cite data we don't have
- **NEVER** estimate based on "general knowledge"
- **NEVER** infer statistics without actual analysis
- **NEVER** claim access to sources we haven't used

### 2. What Constitutes Fabrication

#### ❌ THESE ARE FABRICATIONS:
- "Web of Science has 15% coverage" (without having the data)
- "Based on industry standards..." (without specific source)
- "Typically these databases..." (generalization without evidence)
- "It's reasonable to assume..." (assumption not fact)
- "Most researchers agree..." (without citations)
- "Approximately X based on similar..." (inference without data)

#### ❌ THESE ARE ASSUMPTIONS (Also Forbidden):
- "Shell companies in Cayman Islands" (assumption about intent)
- "Deceptive VIE structures" (adding motive without evidence)
- "Suspicious offshore registration" (interpretation not fact)
- "High risk due to..." (without specific risk criteria)
- "Network of shell companies" (pattern assumption)

#### ✅ THESE ARE ACCEPTABLE:
- "OpenAlex shows 2-3% coverage" (we analyzed this)
- "We detected 1,732 collaborations" (actual count)
- "Cannot determine due to lack of data" (acknowledging limitation)
- "No data available" (honest assessment)
- "41 companies registered in Cayman Islands" (factual observation)
- "11 companies disclosed VIE structures" (from filings)
- "39 incorporated in jurisdiction with 0% tax" (verifiable fact)

### 3. Verification Requirements

Every claim must have:
1. **Source file/database** - Where did the data come from?
2. **Extraction method** - How was it obtained?
3. **Processing code** - What analysis was performed?
4. **Audit trail** - Can someone reproduce this?

### 4. Language Requirements

#### ❌ FORBIDDEN PHRASES:
- "It is estimated that..."
- "Based on typical patterns..."
- "Industry standards suggest..."
- "Comparable databases show..."
- "We can infer that..."
- "It's reasonable to assume..."

#### ✅ REQUIRED PHRASES:
- "Our data shows..."
- "We detected..."
- "Analysis revealed..."
- "Cannot determine without data"
- "No evidence available"
- "Data not in our possession"

### 5. Handling Unknown Information

When we don't have data:

**WRONG:** "Web of Science likely has 15% coverage"

**CORRECT:** "We do not have Web of Science data. We cannot make claims about its coverage."

**WRONG:** "Similar databases suggest..."

**CORRECT:** "We have no data on this aspect."

### 6. Documentation Standards

Every analysis must document:
```markdown
## Data Source
- Database: [Exact name and version]
- Access Date: [When accessed]
- Files Analyzed: [Specific files]
- Records Processed: [Exact count]

## Limitations
- What we DON'T have: [List]
- What we CAN'T determine: [List]
- Confidence level: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW with justification]
```

### 7. Quality Assurance Checklist

Before any report:
- [ ] Every number traced to source data?
- [ ] Every percentage calculated from our data?
- [ ] Every comparison based on actual analysis?
- [ ] All limitations explicitly stated?
- [ ] No "general knowledge" claims?
- [ ] No unsourced estimates?
- [ ] No fabricated examples?

### 8. Correction Protocol

If fabrication detected:
1. **IMMEDIATE** correction in all documents
2. **LOG** the incident with root cause
3. **DOCUMENT** what was wrong and why
4. **UPDATE** protocols to prevent recurrence
5. **NOTIFY** if report was distributed

### 9. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **The "Reasonable Estimate" Trap**
   - Just because something sounds reasonable doesn't make it true
   - All estimates must be based on actual data

2. **The "Industry Knowledge" Trap**
   - General knowledge about databases is not evidence
   - Each database must be analyzed independently

3. **The "Comparable Systems" Trap**
   - One system's characteristics don't predict another's
   - Each source needs independent verification

4. **The "Missing Data Interpolation" Trap**
   - Don't fill gaps with assumptions
   - Missing data should remain missing

### 10. Enforcement

- **Every team member** responsible for compliance
- **Every report** must pass zero-fabrication review
- **Every claim** must have evidence
- **No exceptions** for "obvious" facts

## Red Flags for Review

Watch for these warning signs:
- Round numbers without source (e.g., "about 15%")
- Comparative claims without both datasets
- Technical specifications without documentation
- Coverage estimates without actual analysis
- Any use of "typically," "usually," "generally"
- Interpretive labels ("shell", "deceptive", "suspicious")
- Intent attribution ("hiding", "circumventing", "avoiding")
- Risk claims without specific criteria
- Pattern claims without statistical analysis

## The Golden Rule

**"If we didn't count it, calculate it, or observe it directly from data in our possession, we cannot claim it."**

## Proper Terminology Guidelines

### Geographic Registration
- ✅ "Registered in [Country]"
- ✅ "Incorporated in [Jurisdiction]"
- ✅ "41 companies with Cayman Islands registration"
- ❌ "Shell companies in [Country]"
- ❌ "Network of shells"

### Operational Status
- ✅ "Reports no employees per 10-K filing"
- ✅ "No revenue reported in financial statements"
- ✅ "Holding company structure per org chart"
- ❌ "Empty shell with no operations"
- ❌ "Dormant entity"

### Corporate Structures
- ✅ "Variable Interest Entity disclosed in filing"
- ✅ "VIE structure noted, common for Chinese listings"
- ✅ "11 companies use VIE structures"
- ❌ "Deceptive VIE structures"
- ❌ "Structures designed to circumvent law"

### Risk Assessment
- ✅ "Offshore registration noted as risk factor"
- ✅ "Chinese operations disclosed"
- ✅ "Jurisdiction has 0% corporate tax rate"
- ❌ "High risk due to suspicious structure"
- ❌ "Red flags detected"

## Incident Prevention

1. **Before writing:** "Do I have data for this?"
2. **While writing:** "Can I show the source?"
3. **After writing:** "Can someone verify this?"
4. **Before publishing:** "Is anything here assumed?"

## Recovery from Violations

1. **Acknowledge the error immediately**
2. **Correct all affected documents**
3. **Document lessons learned**
4. **Strengthen processes**
5. **No blame, focus on improvement**

## Key Principles

**"The facts are interesting enough. We don't need to embellish them."**

A company being registered in Cayman Islands IS valuable intelligence without calling it a "shell."

**"The truth about what we don't know is more valuable than fabricated estimates."**

## Commitment

This protocol exists because:
- **Credibility** depends on accuracy
- **Trust** requires verification
- **Intelligence** needs integrity
- **Decisions** require truth

Every fabrication or assumption, no matter how small or "reasonable," undermines the entire analysis.

## Remember

❌ "Web of Science has 15% coverage" (fabrication - no data)
✅ "We don't have Web of Science data" (truth)

**The truth about what we don't know is more valuable than fabricated estimates.**

## SECTION 11: SOURCE ACCESS SECURITY POLICY (Added 2025-11-08)

### Critical Security Requirement: ZERO .cn DOMAIN ACCESS

**Policy:** NEVER access any .cn domain or PRC government website directly.

**Applies to:** ALL Chinese government policy documents, regulations, laws, and official statements

### A. Prohibited Access

**NEVER access:**
- Any .cn domain (gov.cn, npc.gov.cn, ndrc.gov.cn, miit.gov.cn, most.gov.cn, mod.gov.cn, etc.)
- Chinese state media websites (xinhuanet.com, chinadaily.com.cn, etc.)
- Any PRC government website regardless of TLD
- Any PRC state-controlled infrastructure

**Rationale:**
1. **Network Security**: Avoid potential malware, tracking, or attribution
2. **Operational Security**: Prevent profiling of research activities
3. **Data Integrity**: Western sources provide verified translations with provenance
4. **Fallback Prohibition**: If Western source unavailable, DOCUMENT GAP, do not access .cn

### B. Approved Sources for Chinese Policy Documents

**Tier 1 - Western Academic Translations (REQUIRED):**
- ✅ Georgetown CSET (cset.georgetown.edu)
- ✅ Stanford DigiChina (digichina.stanford.edu)
- ✅ China Law Translate (chinalawtranslate.com)
- ✅ Leiden University - China Copyright and Media

**Tier 2 - US Government Sources:**

- ✅ Department of Defense
- ✅ Federal Register (federalregister.gov)

**Tier 3 - Think Tank Analysis (Secondary Sources):**
- ✅ MERICS, CSIS, ASPI, Brookings, ChinaFile

**Tier 4 - Archive Fallback (EXTREME CAUTION):**
- ⚠️ Internet Archive (archive.org) - ONLY when Western translation unavailable
  - MUST verify archive date
  - If archive doesn't load, DO NOT access live .cn site

### C. Acquisition Workflow Compliance

```
Step 1: Check F:/Policy_Documents_Sweep and F:/CSET - Reports
Step 2: Check Georgetown CSET, Stanford DigiChina, China Law Translate
Step 3: Check US government sources (USCC, CRS, Federal Register)
Step 4: Check think tanks for analysis with excerpts
Step 5: If not found - DOCUMENT GAP, set recheck date
Step 6: ❌ NEVER access .cn domain as fallback
```

### D. Metadata Requirements for Compliance

**REQUIRED fields for all Chinese policy documents:**

```json
{
  "source_url_western": "https://cset.georgetown.edu/...",
  "translation_source": "Georgetown CSET",
  "original_chinese_url_cited_only": "http://www.gov.cn/... (CITED, NOT ACCESSED)",
  "no_cn_access_confirmed": true,
  "verified_safe_source": true
}
```

### E. Citation Format for Chinese Documents

**Format:**
```
[Document Title in English], [Issuing Body], [Publication Date], translated by [Western Institution], available at [Western URL], accessed [Date].

Original Chinese: [Chinese Title], [Chinese Issuing Body], [Document Number] (cited from [Western Source], NOT accessed directly).
```

**Example:**
```
Made in China 2025, State Council, May 19, 2015, translated by Georgetown CSET, https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/made-in-china-2025/, accessed November 8, 2025.

Original: 中国制造2025, 国务院, 国发〔2015〕28号 (cited from Georgetown CSET, NOT accessed directly).
```

### F. Security Incident Response

**If accidental .cn access occurs:**

1. **STOP** - Do not download or save data
2. **DOCUMENT** the incident
3. **REPORT** to security team
4. **QUARANTINE** any downloaded files
5. **DO NOT INGEST** data into database
6. **RE-ACQUIRE** from approved Western source

### G. Compliance Verification

**Pre-ingestion checklist addition:**
- [ ] Source is from approved Western/US government list
- [ ] NO .cn domains accessed
- [ ] Metadata includes `no_cn_access_confirmed: true`
- [ ] Provenance chain shows Western source only
- [ ] Translation source documented

**Audit trail must show:**
- Western source URL for every Chinese document
- Translation institution documented
- NO .cn domains in acquisition logs
- Compliance flag set in database

### H. Gap Documentation

**When Western translation is unavailable:**

```json
{
  "document_title": "Strategic Outline for Military-Civil Fusion",
  "status": "NOT AVAILABLE VIA WESTERN SOURCES",
  "sources_checked": [
    "Georgetown CSET - no translation",
    "Stanford DigiChina - no translation",
    "USCC - excerpts only"
  ],
  "alternative_approach": "Use USCC excerpts - mark SECONDARY SOURCE",
  "recheck_date": "2025-12-08",
  "cn_domain_access": "PROHIBITED - gap documented"
}
```

### I. Enforcement

**This security policy is MANDATORY and has same status as Zero Fabrication Protocol.**

**Violations:**
- Accessing .cn domains = Security Policy Violation
- Using data from .cn source = Zero Fabrication Violation
- Failing to document Western source = Compliance Violation

**All violations must be logged in Critical Incident Log above.**
