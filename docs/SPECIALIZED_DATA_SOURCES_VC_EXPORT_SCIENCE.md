## 🎯 KEY INTELLIGENCE QUESTIONS

### For Each Data Source, Ask:
1. **Who is investing?** (VC data)
2. **What are they buying?** (Procurement data)
3. **What can't they buy?** (Export control)
4. **Where is it going?** (Trade data)
5. **Who are the intermediaries?** (Network analysis)

### Technology Transfer Indicators:
- VC investment followed by IP transfer
- Scientific equipment purchase before breakthrough
- Export license denials followed by third-country procurement
- Joint ventures in controlled technology areas
