## 10. CONCLUSIONS

### Strategic Assessment
China has systematically penetrated European and global markets through multiple vectors:
1. **Procurement:** Critical infrastructure control
2. **Research:** Knowledge and talent acquisition
3. **Patents:** Technology transfer mechanisms
4. **Finance:** Capital influence and ownership

### Threat Level: **HIGH TO CRITICAL**

The convergence of procurement contracts, research collaborations, patent partnerships, and financial structures indicates a coordinated strategic campaign rather than organic market participation.

### Intelligence Gaps
1. Subsidiary and shell company networks
2. Personnel movement patterns
3. Classified research collaborations
4. Military-civil fusion indicators
