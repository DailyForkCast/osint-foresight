- **Translation needed**: Not all sources in English

### Technical
- **Rate limits** vary by source (10-1000 req/hour)
- **Authentication complexity** for EU systems

## 🔍 UNIQUE INSIGHTS POSSIBLE

With this infrastructure, we can answer:

1. **Which countries are actually deploying quantum computing?**
   - Not just research, but production deployment

2. **What are the hidden supply chain dependencies?**
   - Suppliers not in any database

3. **Who is winning the AI race in Europe?**
   - Beyond papers - actual deployment

4. **Where are the innovation clusters forming?**
   - Network analysis across all sources

5. **What technologies are converging?**
   - Cross-domain citation and collaboration patterns

6. **Which SMEs are punching above their weight?**
   - Hidden champions in niche technologies

7. **What are the early warning signals?**
   - Leading indicators from multiple sources

8. **Where are the talent flows?**
   - Researcher mobility, brain drain/gain

9. **What standards will dominate?**
   - Early participation patterns

10. **Which partnerships matter?**
    - Not announced but visible in data

## 📝 MASTER PROMPT UPDATES NEEDED

Key points to emphasize:

1. **Common Crawl is PRIMARY** for adoption detection (not supplementary)
2. **28 countries automated**, 16 need manual quarterly work
3. **Multilingual search critical** - 20+ languages configured
4. **EPO OPS unlikely** - use Google Patents
5. **CORDIS bulk pending** - have scraping backup
6. **OpenAlex complete** - 420GB on F: drive
7. **Focus on dual-use** - 15 technology categories defined
8. **Manifest system** prevents re-downloading
9. **National differences** significant in data availability
10. **Technology adoption** detection fully configured
